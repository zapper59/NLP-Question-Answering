The revelation about Jon's real parentage means that he may potentially bond with one of Daenerys's three dragons in a future novel - after all, she has three dragons but only personally rides Drogon, the largest. To a lesser extent this might also be true of the Baratheons - Robert Baratheon was Rhaegar's second cousin in the books. With the deaths of Stannis and Shireen in the TV series, the only living member of the Baratheon bloodline is Robert's bastard son Gendry (who is in fact Jon Snow's third cousin). House Martell also intermarried with the Targaryens but not recently, about a century ago: in the books Doran Martell's middle son Quentyn (cut from the TV show) traveled to Meereen and explicitly hoped his small amount of Targaryen blood would be enough to make the dragons trust him and try to mount one, but he got roasted alive instead.
