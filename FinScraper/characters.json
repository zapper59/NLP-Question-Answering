Like her father, Cersei has always blamed Tyrion for her mother's death and deeply resents that her mother died so that Tyrion would be brought into the world.   As for Cersei's father Tywin, he was constantly away from home during her childhood and teenage years, serving as Hand of the King at the capital, with only infrequent visits back to his seat at Casterly Rock. Coupled with the death of her mother, this meant that Cersei and her two brothers were primarily raised by servants attached to House Lannister.

She nevertheless bore Robert a son who died shortly after his birth. Cersei was devastated by the loss of her son and refused to have the body taken from her, forcing Robert to hold her while they took her son from her.

Cersei notes that it no mercy to let the boy live, after which Tyrion snidely remarks that only the Gods know his fate.

Cersei elucidates that the North is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders. She cautions Joffrey that he will need to be cleverer as king.

She was partially successful in her scheme to have Ned Stark falsely confess to treason before exiling him to the Wall in order to keep the North and the Riverlands in line. However, she failed to predict that Joffrey would be so foolish as to start a war by having Ned executed instead. Her scheme to undermine the Tyrells' plot to marry Loras to Sansa backfires on her when Tywin insists that Cersei will marry Loras instead, and coerces the Tyrells into consenting by threatening to have Loras appointed to the Kingsguard if they don't. After Tywin's death, she thinks she can co-opt the Sparrows into undermining the Tyrells, which briefly succeeds by having Loras and then Margaery imprisoned by the Faith Militant, but this plan ultimately backfired on her as well when she too was imprisoned and force to perform a walk of atonement In this particular case, the combination of Cersei's own ego, as well as her belief that the Sparrows were loyal to her alone, did not allow her to comprehend that the same tactics she used against the Tyrells could also be used against her.Cersei's plan to destroy the Faith Militant and the Tyrells backfires on her as well with the suicide of Tommen, her last living child. Finally, Cersei's scheme to betray the Targaryens and the North after the parley of King's Landing has already backfired somewhat with Jaime abandoning her. "}, {"context": "A mistake outsiders often make when dealing with Cersei is assuming that she has the emotional maturity and wisdom of a queen, or at least an adult, when her real personality is closer to a petulant child inhabiting an adult's body (indeed, Lena Headey has stated that she plays Cersei as having the mind of a wayward 15 year old who never had any real parenting).  With her mother dead at a young age and her father away at court (and a cold disciplinarian anyway), Cersei was functionally raised by servants. In public, Cersei often tries to exude a sense of calm and regal control over her surroundings. When things do not go her own way, however, Cersei's usual response is to become childishly flippant, even when the assembled Small Council is trying to give her advice which would genuinely serve her own interests. "}, {"context": "She also has a tendency to irrationally blame other people for problems she actually started herself though her ego won't let her admit otherwise. When Jaime reminds her that the world mustn't know Myrcella really is their daughter, she hypocritically faults him for his caution, saying it led to Joffrey being murdered and Myrcella being sent to Dorne in the first place, even though she was the one who had Joffrey installed on the throne in the first place rather than flee when Ned Stark warned her of his intentions in order to spare her children's lives. Although she later acknowledges that Tyrion did not in fact kill Joffrey, she blames him for the deaths of her other two children by sending Myrcella to Dorne and killing Tywin, an act that she says made the Lannisters vulnerable to their enemies. Again, Cersei forgets that Tyrion's actions were brought on entirely by her own, namely her failure to stop Joffrey from executing Ned and igniting a war, and later irrationally accusing Tyrion for Joffrey's murder. "}, {"context": "Cersei's behavior is very mercurial, capable of switching between seemingly true affection for someone to extreme loathing over trifles. She is very petty about even small slights, both real and imagined, which ended up being her undoing, for she tried to use the Faith Militant to undermine House Tyrell due to her dislike of Margaery and the fact she replaced her as Queen, only to lose House Tyrell as an ally and find a powerful enemy in the Faith Militant As Tyrion noted, Cersei often uses her honest feelings to dishonestly manipulate other people. For example, her fear for the safety of her children is actually genuine, but she will shamelessly use this to play on the sympathy of other people, to sway them into supporting her.  "}, {"context": "Cersei despises the restraints placed on her because she is a woman and is jealous of the freedoms that men have in her society. Several of the noble Houses in the Seven Kingdoms have more liberal attitudes when it comes to involving female members of their family in politics. The women of House Tyrell for example, are expected to be involved in politics and have thus been trained from a young age in the skills of ruling. Unfortunately, Cersei's father Tywin is a staunch conservative, and never envisioned Cersei playing an active role in politics. Instead, her duty was to cement a marriage alliance and raise royal children, nothing more. It is also possible that instead of her gender being the object, Tywin believes she is simply too impatient and rash. Either way, the practical result is that, right or wrong, Tywin didn't raise Cersei to be skilled in ruling or in political intrigue. While confronted with these shortfalls, Cersei often blames her father or society in general for not giving her the years of training needed to rule, but complaining about it doesn't change the fact that she simply doesn't possess these skills. Although Cersei hates being a woman in Westerosi society, she shows no sympathy towards other women in similar circumstances, scorning them for what she perceives as their weakness: Cersei isn't so much angry at men for mistreating women, as angry that she isn't a man. When she was drunk during the Battle of the Blackwater she even openly said she wished she was born a man.  "}, {"context": "Cersei's lack of a parental relationship growing up is reflected in how poorly she has served as a mother to her own children, for whom she is unable to act as a stable moral instructor. While she certainly dotes on them, she doesn't genuinely \"love\" them so much as she treats them as extensions of herself. She is convinced that she is obsessed with their welfare, but when events threaten to take any of them away from her she is not so much worried about their happiness and well-being as angered that something she feels belongs to her is being taken away.  "}, {"context": "Tyrion once observed that Cersei's love for her children is her one obvious redeeming quality - but she even managed to twist this into a negative.  Cersei doesn't really \"love\" her children so much as she is obsessed with her mental constructs of them. She spent Joffrey's entire childhood convinced that he was going to grow up to be the best king ever, wise and brave - to the point that she blinded herself to his obviously psychopathic behavior. However, in spite of her obvious favoritism and far from realistic conception of her son, she at least acknowledged that Joffrey was indeed a monster after his death, implying she wasn't as deluded as she appeared. Her overindulgence of Joffrey also spoiled him rotten, filling him with an insatiable sense of entitlement - nor did he particularly give her much respect in return. Meanwhile, Cersei seems oblivious to the fact that she ignored her two younger children, Myrcella and Tommen While Cersei is constantly upset that her own father Tywin played favorites with his children and focused all of his attention on her brother Jaime, she hypocritically visited the same treatment on her own children. She fixated on Joffrey so much that she barely knew Myrcella and Tommen, rarely engaging them in conversation except when she needed to manipulate them.  After Myrcella was sent away to Dorne in a marriage-alliance, Cersei assumed she was suffering away from her family, not suspecting that Myrcella would actually find happiness once she was free from Cersei's control and not even want to come back to her.  After spending some years in Dorne away from her, Myrcella outright said that Cersei doesn't even know her.  Finally, after the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei tells a captured Unella, she was motivated by protecting her last living child, Tommen. However, Cersei once again proves what a poor parent she is by not going immediately to Tommen after his wife is killed in the explosion and preventing his suicide as she was too preoccupied with paying back Unella for imprisoning and humiliating her.  "}, {"context": "After she was humiliated by the Faith Militant, the megalomania, immoralityand vengefulnessCersei possessed all her life reached its peak. Combined with the rage she felt for her uncle Kevan and the fact that Olenna Tyrell and Pycelle deprived her of power, Cersei began plotting with Qyburn to avoid her trial, simultaneously destroy her enemies, including the High Sparrow and Queen Margaery and gain her revenge on the faith militant.This ended up destroying the alliance with the Tyrells, the only effective ally to King's Landing and a bloody revolt is to be expected by a vindictive Olenna. Cersei, however, does not seem concerned regarding this, displaying much more recklessness and slight mental imbalance on her part. Despite declaring herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, the title is effectively meaningless as currently the only major houses supporting her are her own and the Freys, although with the death of Walder Frey as well as the Freys' apparent military incompetence they are unlikely to be useful allies. Along with the Lannisters now pitted against the rest of the great houses of Westeros, there is also the matter of the Crown's debt to the Iron Bank which has still not been resolved. So while Cersei might have achieved her ultimate ambition of being crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she is still in an incredibly precarious situation. However, this appears lost on her, further demonstrating her inability to see the far-reaching consequences of her actions. "}, {"context": "Beforehand, Cersei was known to have an extremely thinly-veiled sense of morality, which can be attributed to her love for her own children, no matter how twisted it was. Now that Tommen, Joffrey and Myrcella are all dead, however, Cersei has begun displaying more ruthlessness and depravity in her convictions. Her use of wildfire to destroy the Great Sept of Baelor can be considered somewhat of a symbolic envoi to her own descent into the same level of tyranny as the the Mad King This act also destroyed the area surrounding the Great Sept for half a mile, effectively murdering hundreds of innocent people. Ironically, this may serve to drive a wedge between her and Jaime; Jaime outright said that the only thing he cares about is Cersei and that he was willing to kill even children if it reunited them, but Cersei has committed an act similar to the one he had to kill the Mad King for. Jaime's grim look upon returning to King's Landing and witnessing her coronation means that he understands that she is becoming exactly like him. "}, {"context": "Regarding her own crimes, Cersei appears to have become shamelessly sadistic. She outwardly admits that all her actions from having Robert killed to having an incestuous relationship with Jaime was solely because she enjoyed doing so. This, she \"confesses\" to a helpless Unella while vengefully playing with her, even quietly chanting \"shame\" (in a similar sense that Unella did during her walk of atonement ) before leaving her to be tortured by Gregor Clegane She also used her own motherly emotions for sadistic purposes when facing off with Ellaria Sand, going so far as to kill Ellaria's daughter Tyene with the same exact method which had been used to kill Myrcella. In the same scene, she vividly recalled Prince Oberyn's death to Ellaria, and pointed out that Oberyn died in vain since Gregor Clegane was still alive and stronger than ever before. "}, {"context": "All of this points to another mistake outsiders often make, Ned Stark for example, when dealing with Cersei as Olenna Tyrell noted before her death: failure to imagine just how far Cersei is willing to go to keep her power.  "}, {"context": "Cersei has been cited by Tyrion to be one of the most dangerous people in Westeros, because of her absolute ruthlessness in the face of those she perceives as her enemies. Cersei maintains a major amount of hypocrisy, blaming Tyrion for the destabilization of her family, and blind to the fact that she was an almost central influence in the deaths of Tommen and Myrcella, and showing no sympathy whatsoever when Tyrion apologizes but cites Tywin's own cruelty towards him - the hypocrisy here is that Cersei herself has complained about Tywin's mistreatment of her, and outright threatened to 'burn [her] house to the ground' if she were separated from her children (the latter being hopelessly ironic because Cersei accuses Tyrion of decimating the position of House Lannister, where she at least contemplated it herself). In addition, Cersei was a supreme influence in the arrest of Ned Stark (since she installed Joffrey on the Iron Throne rather than leave King's Landing when Ned warned her of his intentions in order to spare her children's lives), Tyrion's arrest (since it began with Bran Stark finding her having sex with Jaime), and giving free reign for Joffrey to do as he wanted and being unable to control him (which led to the death of Eddard Stark), making her an almost undisputed influence in the War of the Five Kings, which led to her family's decimation. "}, {"context": "Cersei has also become increasingly more arrogant and callous with her ascension to queen, disrespecting Jaime as the stupidest Lannister, having seen his logical and sound keeping of his promise as a betrayal. Perceiving this betrayal, Cersei feigns a threat with Ser Gregor, but Jaime knowing his sister so well as he does, calls it out. But the feelings of hurt are still the same.Cersei expresses her need to protect their new child by allowing the enemies to eliminate each other. By all logical guesses, it looks as if she is mimicking what Tywin Lannister had done during the end of Robert's Rebellion where he camped out and waited until the end game to see what he could do with what was left. Cersei Lannister's character has always been what it has always been about: Being a mother and ensuring the survival of the ones she loves, and that is her children and her lover, Jaime Lannister. Her behavior reinforces the belief that she has stated since thevery beginning, that when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die, and there is no middle ground.

However, the production team was so enthusiastic about her performance, and the larger scale concern of having Headey play Cersei for several years, that they didn't recast the role but instead worked around her pregnancy by, for example, keeping the camera frame above her waist or having her sit at a table. For wide shots when Cersei is walking around, notice that most of Cersei's costumes in Season 1 have large billowing sleeves which she carries in front of her to hide her pregnancy. At other times, body doubles were shot from behind in quick-cuts. This may also explain why Cersei's sex scene with Jaime isn't as involved as it is in the books, in which they are both completely naked and have an extended conversation intermixed with lovemaking. In the TV series, Cersei and Jaime are mostly clothed, with Jaime simply pulling her dress up, and Jaime is taking her from behind, so the viewer can't see that the actress is pregnant.

Why Headey ultimately used a body double is unclear: one possible but unconfirmed explanation is that in February 2015 (after filming had ended), Headey revealed that she was pregnant with her second child - but she was so upset about how the media had been invasive about the divorce of her first marriage that she would not reveal who the father was, or any other details about her personal life. Therefore it is unknown when she first became pregnant and if this could have interfered with any nude scenes. "}, {"context": "Headey later revealed that the real reason she didn't do the nude scene herself is simply because she felt she wouldn't be able to stay in-character: Cersei is supposed to make the entire penance walk with an utterly stoic face, but Headey felt she could not restrain herself from emoting (as extras also fling filth and insults at her) - not that she felt she would start crying, but rather, that she felt she couldn't restrain herself from reacting angrily glaring at the crowd, when it is explicitly important that the character doesn't react.

In the novels, however, infant mortality is so high even among the nobility that characters frequently only count the number of their children who survived the cradle.

While stretching the limits of internal consistency, it is still possible that Cersei immediately got pregnant with the black-haired son after marrying Robert at the end of the war, then immediately became pregnant with Joffrey, so two nine-month pregnancies occurred within 18 months/slightly less than two years - which would result in Joffrey still being born in the calendar year after the war ended. It is also possible that the black-haired son died due to being born prematurely, perhaps as early as 32 weeks, giving a few months between the pregnancies.

Sansa accuses Petyr of murdering their aunt Lysa Arryn orchestrating the Assassination of Jon Arryn and conspiring with the Lannisters to betray their father, leading to the deaths of the entire Stark household in King's Landing as well as Ned's execution. At first, Petyr denies these accusations and points out that none of them actually saw him do any of these things. Bran reminds Petyr that he held a knife to his father's throat and repeats what he said to him then: \"I did warn you not to trust me.\" Arya then shows Petyr the very same dagger that was meant to kill Bran and tells him that he lied to their parents about it belonging to Tyrion. Bran watches as his mother's former childhood friend and suitor crumples to the floor and begs for his life before Arya slits his throat with his own dagger.  "}, {"context": "Later, Bran meets with the recently-arrived Samwell Tarly in his chambers. After explaining his abilities to Sam, Bran confirms via raven scroll that Jon is returning to Winterfell alongside Daenerys Targaryen Though Bran already knows the truth about Jon's parentage and stresses that Jon needs to know as well, Sam reveals that Jon is actually the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark the High Septon having secretly annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia Martell Using his Greensight, Bran witnesses the secret wedding of Rhaegar and Lyanna, realizing they genuinely loved each other and that Robert's Rebellion was based on a lie. Revisiting the vision Lyanna giving birth to her son, Bran hears Lyanna tell Ned that Jon's name is Aegon Targaryen, and thus, the one true heir to the Iron Throne. Later, through his flock of ravens at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Bran watches the Night King destroy a large portion of the Wall using the undead Viserion allowing his army to march south.  "}, {"context": "Before the incident of his fall, Bran was an extremely curious and adventurous boy. He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was in large part what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening. After his fall, Bran turned towards melancholy, citing that he would rather be dead than be unable to walk, distressing Robb upon hearing Bran say so. This factor is to be expected, because Bran had a previously extremely adventurous nature and couldn't bear to be unable to continue that way. However, Bran became happier once Tyrion gave him the designs for a special saddle, since he also loved riding as much as he did climbing. Bran had it in him to be a good lord in his own right, as proven by his brief tenure as acting Lord of Winterfell when Robb left to fight Tywin Lannister. "}, {"context": "After Theon Greyjoy betrayed his house and seized Winterfell, Bran's innocence proved to be a disadvantage for him, since Theon coerced him into surrendering Winterfell under the promise that nobody would be harmed. Bran proved unable to predict that Theon, under excruciating pressure from his bad reputation among the ironborn, would break his word the moment somebody openly defied him. Bran was a compassionate young man, still, and pleaded tearfully when Theon ordered for Ser Rodrik Cassel to be executed. Upon meeting Jojen Reed, however, Bran proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha. He became almost unbreakably determined to meet the Three-Eyed Raven that kept coming to him in his dreams, even if it meant separating from his brother Rickon and, later on, from Jon Snow (who would have protected him at Castle Black). When Bran finally reached the Three-Eyed Raven, one of the first things he pressed the Three-Eyed Raven about is whether or not Bran could walk again, and is briefly disappointed when told that he will never walk again. "}, {"context": "After growing up under the tutelage of the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran maintains his curious nature, especially when he and the Raven visit Winterfell; his curiosity piques when he sees his long-dead aunt Lyanna. Bran is disappointed by the prospect of returning to the real world. Later on, Bran expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realized that Arthur Dayne lost only because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honorable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realized that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers only to be silenced when Leaf cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action. He also shows incredulity at what his own powers can accomplish, as shown when he realizes how he is responsible for breaking Hodor 's mind in the first place. "}, {"context": "Upon returning from Beyond the Wall, Bran's personality has changed significantly, as a result of the expansion his powers have taken since the battle at the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven He has become extremely calm to a fault, to the point of being almost detached from everyone else around him. Having become the new Three-Eyed Raven, Bran has been given access to many more events, which he explains several times, so much that Bran becomes aware of almost anything, for example the wedding between his sister Sansa and Ramsay Bolton and even the conversation between Littlefinger and Varys He also shows a rather dangerous and threatening side, as evidenced by his deadpan recital of Chaos is a ladder to Petyr Baelish, outright showing that he knows how treacherous Petyr is and what he has done against House Stark in the past, but also suggesting that Petyr is unable to manipulate him. Also, Bran shows himself to have become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him. However, Bran is not truly omniscient, as he still needs to witness events in order to find out about them, as shown by his surprise when he heard that Rhaegar and Lyanna were secretly married.

Catelyn, however, wishes for Bran to remain in Winterfell with her and prays to the Seven Gods for something to keep Bran from leaving.

Bran's the only one Robb can confess his fears and insecurities to while their bannermen take turns challenging Robb's authority.

Through the vision, Bran learns that Hodor used to be a stable boy named \"Wylis\" before he became simpleton, who is carefully protected from harm by a middle-aged Old Nan. While Bran longs to stay in the vision, he is pulled out by the Three-Eyed Raven, who warns him that he may become too enamored with the past to want to return to reality. Bran finds Meera outside the cave viewing the world beyond; still grieving over the loss of Jojen. Meera tells Bran that she was having trouble coping with their apparent inaction to the coming war.

While Gerold Hightower is killed early on, Arthur Dayne single-handedly defeats nearly all of Ned's retainers, and is about to kill Ned himself when Howland Reed unexpectedly stabs Dayne through the back of the neck, having been injured early on, but not killed. Bran is shocked that the stories he heard were not as honorable as the events that actually unfolded. Ned finishes off Dayne by partially decapitating him with his own sword, Dawn and hears a woman scream from the tower. As Ned runs into the tower to find Lyanna, Bran calls out to him. Ned stops to look around, but is confused because he cannot find the source of the voice. Before Bran can discover what is in the tower for himself, the Three-Eyed Raven brings both of them out of the past.

Hodor, now himself, held the door to hold the wights from killing everyone, and was slowly being overwhelmed. Meera carries Brans unconscious body away into the Northern winter. Desperate and scared, she screams Hold the Door. Still in the vision of the past of Winterfell Bran sees young Wylis/Hodor collapse after his mind returns to his body. Young Wylis keeps screaming hold the door repeatedly until it slurs into Hodor: Brans possession of young Wylis in his vision of the past breaks young Wyliss mind and he hears the echoes of Meeras screams, which made his mind simple and only capable of repeating a form of the last words he heard before his death, \"Hodor\".

With all three surviving children of Ned and Catelyn Stark together, Bran gives Arya the dagger, explaining it is wasted on a cripple. When she asks why such a lowborn assassin would have a dagger made of Valyrian steel, Bran monotonously says that someone of a much higher position of power must have hired him and given the dagger to him.

Revisiting the vision Lyanna giving birth to her son, Bran hears Lyanna tell Ned that Jon's name is Aegon Targaryen, and thus, the one true heir to the Iron Throne. Later, through his flock of ravens at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Bran watches the Night King destroy a large portion of the Wall using the undead Viserion allowing his army to march south.  "}, {"context": "Before the incident of his fall, Bran was an extremely curious and adventurous boy. He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was in large part what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening. After his fall, Bran turned towards melancholy, citing that he would rather be dead than be unable to walk, distressing Robb upon hearing Bran say so. This factor is to be expected, because Bran had a previously extremely adventurous nature and couldn't bear to be unable to continue that way. However, Bran became happier once Tyrion gave him the designs for a special saddle, since he also loved riding as much as he did climbing. Bran had it in him to be a good lord in his own right, as proven by his brief tenure as acting Lord of Winterfell when Robb left to fight Tywin Lannister.

Bran proved unable to predict that Theon, under excruciating pressure from his bad reputation among the ironborn, would break his word the moment somebody openly defied him. Bran was a compassionate young man, still, and pleaded tearfully when Theon ordered for Ser Rodrik Cassel to be executed. Upon meeting Jojen Reed, however, Bran proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha. He became almost unbreakably determined to meet the Three-Eyed Raven that kept coming to him in his dreams, even if it meant separating from his brother Rickon and, later on, from Jon Snow (who would have protected him at Castle Black).

Bran is disappointed by the prospect of returning to the real world. Later on, Bran expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realized that Arthur Dayne lost only because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honorable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realized that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers only to be silenced when Leaf cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action. He also shows incredulity at what his own powers can accomplish, as shown when he realizes how he is responsible for breaking Hodor 's mind in the first place. "}, {"context": "Upon returning from Beyond the Wall, Bran's personality has changed significantly, as a result of the expansion his powers have taken since the battle at the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven He has become extremely calm to a fault, to the point of being almost detached from everyone else around him. Having become the new Three-Eyed Raven, Bran has been given access to many more events, which he explains several times, so much that Bran becomes aware of almost anything, for example the wedding between his sister Sansa and Ramsay Bolton and even the conversation between Littlefinger and Varys He also shows a rather dangerous and threatening side, as evidenced by his deadpan recital of Chaos is a ladder to Petyr Baelish, outright showing that he knows how treacherous Petyr is and what he has done against House Stark in the past, but also suggesting that Petyr is unable to manipulate him. Also, Bran shows himself to have become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him. However, Bran is not truly omniscient, as he still needs to witness events in order to find out about them, as shown by his surprise when he heard that Rhaegar and Lyanna were secretly married.

One of the reasons that people started to favor him over Daeron was the fact that Daemon looked every inch a king, was strong and charismatic and there were rampant rumors that Daeron was actually a bastard sired by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. People already were skeptical of Daeron, who was not a martial man and more scholarly. In fairness, it was a rather long time before Daemon rebelled, and it was rumored that his half-brother Aegor Rivers had been the man to convince him to do so, along with the master-at-arms Ser Quentyn Ball.

Brynden was cursed as a \"kinslayer\" for this, despite there being no way of knowing whose arrow had struck the fatal blow itself (though either way, it was a company of archers he commanded).

Rhaegar Targaryen was a ninth-generation descendant of Daemon, or put another way, \"great-great-etc grandson\" with seven \"greats\" in it. Rhaegar was the same age as his distant cousin Oberyn when he died, so assuming the same number of generations passed in both House Targaryen and House Martell during the intervening 120+ years, Oberyn was also a ninth generation descendant of Daemon. Out of universe, of course, it appears that Martin developed Oberyn as a character first when he was writing the main novels in the 1990s, and then in the late 2000's when he started developing more of the backstory about the Dance of the Dragons, he retroactively wrote Oberyn's ancestor as having a similar personality.

Daario arrives telling her that Hizdahr is in the throne room awaiting her. Dany asks Barristan if hell be joining them, but Daario assures her that he has her well protected, despite claiming she could easily defend herself against Hizdahr.

As a result, Daenerys has never known a true home. Constantly living under her brother's domination has given Daenerys a great empathy with the downtrodden of the world. She is deeply sympathetic to those she perceives as oppressed, while at the same time, her pent-up frustration from years of being mentally and physically dominated by her petty would-be-king of a brother make Daenerys capable of being utterly ruthless against those she perceives as oppressing others. This has produced a large amount of black-white thinking in Daenerys's mind, and she can be idealistic to a fault. For example, on seeing the plight of the slaves in Slaver's Bay Daenerys becomes determined that she must free all of the slaves in the region - with little thought devoted to the practical after-effects which will result from this. A particular example is when the Great Masters of Meereen crucified 163 children as she approached the city, in an attempt to intimidate her. After she took the city, instead of pardoning the slave-masters, she had 163 of them crucified in retribution, including many who opposed the crucifixion of the children, unconcerned about any negative political fallout which would result.

She is also responsible for the deaths of Randyll and Dickon Tarly after she had them burned alive as well for being her opposition. This quality might have further soured her reputation in Westeros along with Cersei's anti-Daenerys propaganda. However, it is worth noting that she executed them only after offering them the choice of surrender, which they declined. Tyrion also seemed to believe that her execution of Randyll and Dickon Tarly to be the result of losing her temper rather than deliberate ruthlessness.

She can be ruthless to her perceived enemies, but while Viserys was cruel and demanding to his servants and even his benefactors, Daenerys reciprocates the loyalty of those who follow her with gratitude and compassion, especially her inner circle of friends and her dragons. On the other hand, insanity was often a late-onset condition in the Targaryens, and it remains to be seen how Daenerys's mentality develops as she matures. One could argue that burning the remaining men of House Tarly with dragonfire could be a telltale sign of Targaryen madness, however, both were men in open rebellion to her who refused to bend the knee, thus making the distinction different. "}, {"context": "Despite her perceived confidence and ruthlessness, Daenerys has displayed surprisingly tender emotion and at times can appear quite vulnerable, at least in private. Her fondness for children has been shown multiple times, and when Drogon incinerated the young daughter of shepherd in Meereen, she was visibly disturbed, which led to her locking Rhaegal and Viserion in the catacombs to prevent further atrocities. When attempting to quell the opposition to her rule in Meereen, she finds herself at a loss and desperately asks Missandei for her input, not trying to hide her frazzled state. After rescuing Jon Snow and company from a wight attack - and losing Viserion in the process - she doesn't try to hide her tears. In the same interaction, when Jon declares his loyalty to her and says that the other Northern lords will come to see her as he does, she says in a rather small voice \"I hope I deserve it.\", showing a sense of doubt that had rarely been displayed before.

She has won some impressive victories, especially her swift conquest of Slaver's Bay and the Siege of Meereen, but each time she had a vast (and unexpected) advantage in numbers, as well as the support of her three dragons. Thus, her victories have more to do with overwhelming the enemy than brilliant tactical leadership. On the other hand, knowing that she is inexperienced in the art of warfare, Daenerys has taken care to surround herself with experienced and capable warriors who can advise her and help her coordinate her battles. She also has a clear sense of strategy, if not tactics; she knows how to win a battle in such a way to leave her in the strongest position possible, and she avoids heavy casualties to conserve and protect the troops at her disposal.

When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty, she is styled officially as \"Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name\" (Xaro is the first to refer to her in this way  ).

In Season 1, it is obviously a major shift when Daenerys starts to wear Dothraki clothing, showing that she is willing toimmerse herself in their culture in a wayViserys never will, and earns reciprocal respect from them as a result. However, as Season 1 progresses, Daenerys later switches to a different outfit - still in Dothraki fashion, but made of tanned crocodile hide. The Dothraki also wear animal skins, but use horse-leather. Daenerys put her own Targaryen-themed twist on this by still using leather made from an animal, but from a reptile to evoke her ties to the ancient dragons. In Season 2, Daenerys switches to a Qartheen gown that Xaro provides her, yet she switches into different variants in a subtle progression throughout the season. Initially, Daenerys was awed by Xaro's generosity and Qarth's elegance, but almost at the risk of losing herself: as she increasingly starts to doubt Xaro and become dissatisfied with Qarth in general (as it becomes more apparent that none of them will give her the army she needs), she starts incorporating more and more \"Dothraki-style\" features back into her outfit. Instead of the completely Qarth-style gown she wore in \"Garden of Bones\", she starts adding more metal armored pieces or leather, similar to her earlier Dothraki costume.  "}, {"context": "In Season 3, by the time that Daenerys's ship arrives in Slaver's Bay she has shifted into a new outfit which she retains for most of the rest of the season (alternating with others such as her white gown). In the Season 3 Blu-ray, Clapton explained why Daenerys wears a bright blue dress instead of, say, the traditional Targaryen colors of red and black (which Viseryswore): blue was the color of royalty in Khal Drogo's khalasar. It was the color of the expensive dye which they adorned themselves with, more so on special occasions such as Drogo's wedding. This is comparable to how purple was traditionally the color of imperial or royal authority for centuries in Europe, because purple was the most expensive color dye (it could only be made from a rare sea snail). Thus, while in Season 3 Daenerys no longer wears a Dothraki-style \"cut\" to her outfit, she switched to blue colors as a symbol of her authority as a khaleesi and in memory of Drogo.  "}, {"context": "Daenerys begins to wear more white as Seasons 4 and 5 progress. From a production standpoint, this signifies her purity and relative naivet in comparison to the world around her, as she clings to her ideals rather than play politics. It's not clear if there is an in-universe reason for the color (i.e., if it is a Ghiscari royal color). She also plays up her connection to the dragons, with some of her dresses featuring quilting to give the impression of scales, and, since she can now have jewelry made, necklaces and rings in the shape of dragons. Clapton also noted that, no matter what color she is wearing, Daenerys always wears Dothraki riding breeches underneath, as experience has taught her that she needs to be prepared for a quick getaway.

Black and red are the colors of House Targaryen. Daenerys has rarely worn her House colors since her journey began, so her wearing black now is the ultimate expression of her acceptance of her identity as a Targaryen conqueror and the rightful queen of Westeros. "}, {"context": "In the books, Daenerys does not appear to be \"fireproof\". Martin has stated that her ability to survive Drogo's funeral pyre was a special circumstance, a blood magic ritual involving \"fire and blood\" - only life can pay for a life, so burning Mirri Maz Duur in the funeral pyre was enough to awaken the life in the dormant dragon eggs. Under normal circumstances, Daenerys is no more immune to fire than any other human. Her brother Viserys once claimed in the novels that Targaryens were a race above other men, immune to both fire and illness - this was blatantly wrong, given that multiple Targaryens in the past are well-known for having burned to death, and many have succumbed to common illnesses over the years (including greyscale ). Viserys's comment just highlights how little he knew about Targaryen history (or anything else). It does appear that Targaryens seem to have a slightly higher heat tolerance than average, though: at Illyrio's mansion Daenerys takes a bath in near-scalding hot water, despite the protests of her maidservant, but in the novels she thinks to herself how pleasant the heat feels (this also happened in the first episode of the TV series). Still, this is nothing outside the normal human range - i.e. any more than centuries of history have shaped the Dornish to be more comfortable in dry desert heat, or shaped the wildlings to be more accustomed to a cold climate. In fact, when Daenerys rides Drogon out of the Great Pit of Meereen, she is stated to have burns and blisters on her hands from the flames. "}, {"context": "The series, however, appears to suggest that Daenerys might in fact have some actual fireproofing ability. In addition to the bath scene in \" Winter is Coming \", Daenerys doesn't notice the heat from the brazier in \" A Golden Crown \", and notably, her hands are unburnt, while Irri 's are blistered immediately after picking up the egg. It could be argued that she displayed this ability again in \" Valar Morghulis \", when she has her dragons burn down the House of the Undying, although it's possible that the dragons managed to just aim the fire past Daenerys at Pyat Pree (notice her clothes are intact after this incident). Most glaring however, is Daenerys's stunt at the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, from which she emerges again unburnt. In the \"Inside the Episode\" feature for \" Book of the Stranger \", Weiss and Benioff imply that Daenerys does indeed have this ability in some fashion, although she only decided to exploit it after Jorah and Daario showed up. "}, {"context": "It should be pointed out that even if Daenerys is fireproof in the series, there is no indication that all Targaryens are, as most fire-related deaths the House has suffered are mentioned as being similar to those in the books. This adds another layer to Viserys's death: Daenerys was realizing that heat and fire didn't affect her like they did most people, and (correctly) suspected that Viserys lacked this resistance. "}, {"context": "In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daenerys was born on the Targaryen island refuge of Dragonstone eight months after her father's death. Her mother died giving birth to her, and a great storm raged at the moment of her birth, destroying what was left of the Targaryen fleet anchored at Dragonstone, giving rise to the nickname \"Stormborn\".

"}, {"context": "The books go into a little more detail about Daenerys's early life in the Free Cities. Initially, Daenerys lived with Ser Willem and Viserys in Braavos in a house with a big red door. Ser Willem was old and bedridden and yelled at the servants, but was very kind to Daenerys. After several years, Ser Willem died and the servants drove the Targaryen children from the house, taking what money they had. Daenerys was old enough to remember living in this house, and has recurrent dreams about her last sight of the big red door, which came to symbolize the childhood she never had. The house in Braavos was the closest thing to a home Daenerys ever had, but even she never considered herself to be truly home here. Afterwards, the Targaryen children bounced around between different patrons, each enjoying having the Targaryen exiles as guests but abandoning them when the novelty wore off. Some briefly entertained the idea of helping them retake the Iron Throne, but as the years passed and Robert Baratheon's rule appeared more and more secure, the number of patrons dwindled and their lives grew meaner. Daenerys grew up living on the sufferance of others, frequently turned out on the street with little warning when their patrons lost interest in them. Viserys was reduced to pathetically begging for support throughout the Free Cities as they moved from patron to patron. In the process, they traveled from Braavos to Myr, then to Tyrosh, then to Qohor, then to Volantis, then to Lys, and ultimately to Pentos (each of the Free Cities except Norvos and Lorath). They never lived in one place for more than a few months, and their stay in Pentos with Illyrio was actually the longest time they had lived in one place since Braavos (for six months in the books, but stated to be over a year in the TV series). "}, {"context": "Daenerys does not appear to have a particular religious affiliation in the books. She grew up in the Free Cities, which have a more diverse religious composition than Westeros, so she has been exposed to several different religions but finds them to be confusing. Her final chapter in the third novel ( A Storm of Swords - Daenerys VI) begins with an inner narration from her POV in which she ponders aspects of different religions. The Targaryens converted to the Faith of the Seven when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros three hundred years ago, and the ancient Valyrian religion is long extinct. Daenerys's brother Viserys apparently made some effort to explain the basic principles of the Faith of the Seven to her, considering that he hoped they would one day rule again over the Seven Kingdoms, where it is the dominant religion - but Daenerys thinks that the concept of a single god who is split into seven facets is confusing. She is also aware of the Lord of Light religion, given that it is the most popular religion in the Free Cities, but she thinks that its belief in a constant violent struggle between R'hllor and the Great Other to be too violent. Daenerys, therefore, has no particularly strong religious affiliations but is fairly open-minded to the religions of new peoples she meets in Essos. While not outright \"converting\" to the Great Stallion religion of the Dothraki, after marrying Drogo out of love for her husband's god she finds herself praying to the great horse in the sky at times, even after Drogo's death. Still, Daenerys isn't particularly sure what her personal beliefs are. The TV series doesn't spend much time on this question either: it is only in Season 7 that Daenerys bluntly says that she has faith only in herself and not in any god.

To this skepticism, Daeron replied; \"You have a dragon. He stands before you\". The Young Dragon's tactics were brilliant, and his larger strategy was innovative: he feinted an invasion through the passes of the Red Mountains luring all of the Dornish armies to the west. He then followed by sending the real invasion force to make an amphibious landing at the mouth of the Greenblood River itself, at the doorstep of Sunspear The Dornish were caught completely off guard and with their army on the other side of the central deserts.

Others counter that Aegon IV himself started this rumor, because he was disgusted that his trueborn son Daeron was an intelligent and scholarly man, and he simply wished he wasn't really his son.

He was very patient with Sansa's dreamy notions, visibly tolerating her adoration of the idea that she'd marry a handsome prince. When he tried to point out to her that Joffrey lacked bravery, strength of character, and even morality, a 13-year old Sansa was unable to see the truth at the time. He had a strong relationship with Arya, and was one of the few who could tolerate her feisty, adventurous mentality, and even encouraged it. He was, in many ways, like his son Robb, in that his sense of honor and duty ruled every aspect of his being, and he was a charismatic leader to those who served him. Ned had good relationships with both Robb and Jon Snow, the latter who Ned raised as his own alongside his lawful children. Like Robb, Jon inherited Neds traits of honor and duty. Ned treated Jon as his son - regardless of his legitimacy, and despite Jon being his nephew, not his son by blood. Ned was willing to sacrifice his own honor to protect Jon, and spent years letting everyone - including his whole family - believe that Jon was his bastard son to ensure Jon's protection. Ned's death provoked such a brutal reaction from all of his family because they all loved him more than words could say. "}, {"context": "Eddard was highly skilled in combat, both in strategy and in a duel. He killed Ser Gerold Hightower, survived the Battle of the Trident and held his own impressively against the younger Jaime Lannister. He had earned the respect of men like Ser Arthur Dayne, the greatest warrior of his generation - indeed, Ned's sense of honor seemed to impress everyone around him, including the rigid and cold Stannis Baratheon and the cunning Varys. Aside from being selfless, dutiful and brave, he was slow to anger and thus he was one of the very, very few who could withstand the temper and misgivings of Robert Baratheon, with whom he shared a relationship that was a hair's breadth from being considered a brotherly one. Robert admitted that he lacked love for Stannis and Renly Baratheon, and had instead called Ned his brother, showing that Robert's admiration for his old comrade was tremendous. Ned's calm and reasonable mentality was respected firmly by Robert, who recognized that Ned was the only one who would dare say no to him for the right reasons. Robert obviously trusted Ned, begging him on his deathbed to help Joffrey in a way that Robert himself had failed and even naming the man as Protector of the Realm until Joffrey came of age. "}, {"context": "However, he had the fatal weakness of being a poor politician, preferring to take the honorable route than doing what would politically benefit him - Cersei speculated that, in the game of thrones one had to take what was in arm's reach or be damned, but Ned disagreed because the fight he fought was never to survive, but to preserve the lives of those he loved. Despite being usually straightforward, his honor could oftentimes blind him to reason, leading him to make highly impractical decisions and judgments. While intelligent, he wasn't the most imaginative person, which further exacerbated by his rigid sense of honor, made him unable to compromise or consider alternatives, usually going with the simplest and most straightforward course of action. Perhaps the best example is how he confronted Cersei about her children being fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime and not by Robert Baratheon. To save Cersei's children, whom he viewed as innocent and undeserving of punishment, he had proposed exile, even though it was obvious (to anyone with common sense) that Cersei would not accept Ned's offer - which meant givingup her power position and luxurious life and becominga fugitive vagabond; instead, she took an action which Ned could easily predict, based on her former attempt to get Robert killed.Ned's intention was good, but the way he chose to actcost his best friend's life. "}, {"context": "One of Eddard's main flaws was his blunt, tactless attitude (similarly to Stannis). He failed to understand that \"you catch more flies with honey rather than with vinegar\". The best example for that is the manner he expressed his opinion about the suggestion to assassinate Daenerys: by acting so bluntly and disrespectfully toward Robert, Eddard only managed to anger him and make him stick to his decision. It never occurred to Eddard that he should have taken a different approach, like the way Davos tried to dissuade his king on similar circumstances (in the novels): talk with the king in private, calmly and softly, appeal to his conscience. Eventually, Robert did regret his decision, but by then it was too late. "}, {"context": "Eddard often evaluated matters and people by the evidence he saw with his own eyes, rarely ever looking underneath the surface or at the bigger picture. This made him a poor judge of character and he had a bad habit of trusting people, which was a mistake he disastrously made with Petyr Baelish. He also did not predict that Cersei Lannister would be unreasonable enough to turn down his offer of mercy if and when Robert found out that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella weren't his children; a mistake that cost Ned not just his own life, but set off a chain of events that has also so far led to the deaths of his wife, two of his sons and many other lives. Finally, he near-automatically judged Jaime Lannister to havebetrayed his king for dishonorable reasons the moment he discovered the Kingslayer sitting on the Iron Throne with the Mad King's corpse lying at his feet, without asking the knight his side of the story and despite the fact he was a rebel himself. Still, Jaime's arrogance did nothing to dispel this misconception. "}, {"context": "Though rare, he could be self-righteous in his honor. He was quick to judge Jaime's actions as dishonorable, despite himself publicly proclaiming to have sired a child out of wedlock with another woman, which he did in order to protect his nephew (Lyanna's son Jon Snow, birth name Aegon Targaryen) from Robert's wrath. He also accused Jaime of sticking to his Kingsguard vows when his family was being tortured and murdered by Aerys, something he did not do when meeting Barristan Selmy. He also had a tendency to choose personal honor over his duties as a leader of millions, ignoring pragmatic decisions for ones that would allow him to maintain his dignity, even at the potential danger of those he swore to protect (though he usually believed that he'd be capable of warding off the threats). This could be seen in the way he chose to deal with Cersei, and his refusal to participate in Daenerys's assassination, in spite of the immense threat her brother and the Dothraki presented to the Seven Kingdoms. "}, {"context": "Furthermore, as he \"grew up with soldiers\", he tended to put a lot of faith in the mindset and capabilities of efficient warriors and commanders in many matters. Ned had told his illegitimate son (revealed to be nephew) Jon Snow that true friendship is made on the battlefield.

He was unable to predict that Robert, despite having been his best friend, did not have the attributes required to make an effective king.

In response to the episode, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, owners of major book fansite Westeros.org and co-authors with George R.R. Martin of The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, put out an analysis video in which they strongly suspected that this is actually a drastic over-simplification by the showrunners of the TV series - one that botched several basic points about how marriage works in Westeros, and only creates as many problems as it solves: "}, {"context": "No one in the history of Westeros, as described in the novels at least, has ever received an \"annulment\" for a marriage that produced a male heir already: Rhaegar had two children with Elia already, an older daughter and an infant son. \"Divorce\", as such, does not exist in Westeros. Annulments are only granted for very specific reasons, such as if the marriage was never consummated, or if one of the couple was already married (as bigamy is forbidden). It is said in both the books and TV series that Sansa can have her marriage to Tyrion annulled on the grounds that it was never consummated. "}, {"context": "Another possibility is that Rhaegar could have just kept Lyanna as a mistress then legitimized Jon by royal decree - as other kings have done in the past, such as Aegon IV the Unworthy Elio and Linda pointed out that customs for bastardy and legitimization are somewhat different in Westeros from the real Middle Ages, in which the Church was more powerful than the Crown and had control over declaring a child legitimate. The books have established that the Iron Throne is more powerful than the Faith in Westeros, and kings can legitimize bastards without consulting the Faith. "}, {"context": "A major fan theory circulating for some time, which Elio and Linda support, is that rather than get an \"annulment\" from Elia, Rhaegar may have polygamously married Lyanna as a second wife. The Valyrian ancestors of House Targaryen regularly incest marrying brother to sister (or as close a relative as possible), but were also known to practice polygamy - it was comparatively uncommon, but not unknown either. Most famously, Aegon the Conqueror who invaded and united the Seven Kingdoms and forged the Iron Throne was simultaneously married to both of his sisters: Visenya and Rhaenys The Faith of the Seven in Westeros strictly forbids both of these practices, and Aegon tacitly seemed to give the promise that the new Targaryen dynasty would stop following them. Aegon's sons then tried to bring back incestuous marriages, leading to the Faith Militant uprising More specifically, Aegon's younger son Maegor the Cruel a brutal tyrant, also tried to bring back polygamy - the High Septon at the time wouldn't grant him an annulment, despite his wife being apparently barren, because she was the High Septon's own niece. Aegon's grandson Jaehaerys I Targaryen later negotiated peace in the realm, ending the uprisings, but the Targaryens were allowed to keep practicing incestuous marriages. Polygamy, meanwhile, was never specifically outlawed, it just fell out of favor, as the Targaryens were wise enough not to antagonize the Faith again by taking multiple wives (in contrast, they already had an incestuous bloodline, and who they subsequently married wouldn't change that - but they could chose not to take more than one wife). A few key hints exist even centuries later that some Targaryens wanted to revive polygamy if they thought they were powerful enough to get away with it, the chief example of which is Daemon Blackfyre a legitimized bastard son of Aegon IV Targaryen Many people in-universe believe that he launched the Blackfyre Rebellion against his own half-brother the king over his love of his half-sister, who the king sent away in a marriage-alliance. Others counter that Daemon was already married so this doesn't make sense, and his wife had produced seven sons and a number of daughters for him. In turn, this led some maesters to suspect that Daemon secretly intended to marry his sister as his polygamous second wife, and that he was powerful enough to pressure the Faith into accepting this much as they had all of the incest marriages. "}, {"context": "It is generally suspected that Rhaegar wanted a second marriage because he believed he needed to have three children to fulfill part of the prophecy about The Prince That Was Promised - that the \"Prince\" would actually be three people acting together. Elia Martell had very frail health, however, and her first two pregnancies nearly killed her, and the maesters said she would not survive another. "}, {"context": "Another possibility is that perhaps according to the prophecy, The Prince That Was Promised had to be sired by Targaryen and Stark parents, as implied by the phrase \"ice and fire\": the Targaryens are associated with fire (their house sigil is a dragon), and the Starks are associated with ice (they rule the North). That could be the reason Rhaegar chose Lyanna as the mother for the promised child. "}, {"context": "Rhaegar annulling his marriage to Elia Martell introduces the complication that this might lead to his first two children with her being retroactively declared illegitimate (such as when Henry VIII of England ended his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, then her daughter Bloody Mary's enemies used this to argue she wasn't legitimate). While somewhat of a moot point because they died years ago, at the time Rhaegar wouldn't have wanted to risk angering the Dornish like that. Even if Rhaegar hypothetically pressured the High Septon into granting him an annulment on some false pretext or another this would greatly anger the Martells and possibly make them rise in open revolt against the Targaryens. As it happened, during Robert's Rebellion the Martell armies fought for the Targaryens because Elia Martell was a hostage in the Red Keep, and because her children with Rhaegar would one day be the heirs to the Iron Throne. "}, {"context": "Of course, in either scenario, the Martells would not have been amused: even if Rhaegar explicitly made the public declaration that his children with Elia would rank ahead of any children with Lyanna, a future rebellion could break out against Elia's children using the pretext that she had been superseded by Lyanna and her children retroactively made bastards (the legality of the situation is irrelevant - rebels only need a pretext). Polygamously taking Lyanna as a second wife might have stopped short of the Martells openly revolting, but an outright \"annulment\" of Rhaegar's marriage to Elia would much more probably be used as an excuse to disinherit her children. "}, {"context": "Elio and Linda did note that they have no idea how Rhaegar getting an annulment instead of a polygamous marriage would impact Elia's children, whether it would make them bastards or not, because there is no precedent for it - no one ever gets an \"annulment\" for a marriage that already produced children. They did point out, however, that while in real-life history this automatically rendered any children by that first marriage bastards (i.e. Bloody Mary), the same isn't necessarily true in Westeros - even for TV-Rhaegar, getting an \"annulment\" in these circumstances would be such a unique dispensation from the High Septon that, while he was at it, he might have additionally had the annulment phrased in such a way that his children with Elia would officially remain legitimate. Or, he could have just declared them legitimized by royal decree. Clearly, the change to an \"annulment\" introduced a number of complications. Whatever the case, because there is no precedent for how an annulment affects children of a marriage, Game of Thrones Wiki will not treat Rhaegar's two children with Elia as retroactively bastards, until directly confirmed otherwise by the TV series (anything else would be an assumption). "}, {"context": "Elio and Linda also speculated on why the TV showrunners would make such an oversimplification from a polygamous marriage to an annulment, and believed that Benioff and Weiss wanted to make Jon Snow unquestionably the rightful heir to the Iron Throne - when in reality, even in the books, there is no scenario under which his inheritance would not be challenged by his enemies. Rebel armies don't care about the legality of words on paper, all they need is a pretext. Even if Rhaegar polygamously married Lyanna in the books, Jon's enemies would always say that Rhaegar couldn't lawfully do that because it is against the rules of the Faith, and rebel movements would use that argument against them. As Elio and Linda point out, changing this to an \"annulment\" from Elia Martell first solves nothing : now, Jon's enemies can simply argue that the annulment from Elia was unlawful - given that she obviously produced two children for Rhaegar already including a son- and thus his second marriage to Lyanna was bigamous (and unlawful once again).

Euron reveals that he returned only a few days ago, leading Yara to realize that he murdered Balon. She accuses him of the murder, and he freely admits it in front of the other ironborn captains, claiming that Balon only ever led the ironborn into two wars they could not hope to win, and apologizes to the captains for not returning to kill him sooner, a sentiment which they nod and murmur at. Theon says that Yara should be queen because while Euron was \"gallivanting\" around the Known World she was leading the ironborn and planning to return the Iron Islands to their former glory, by building the largest fleet the world has ever seen. Mocking Theon's vocabulary, Euron counters that in his travels, he has seen more of the world than the rest of the captains combined, and that he knows that Daenerys Targaryen who owns three large dragons hates the lords of Westeros as much as the ironborn, and has neither a husband nor ships.

Aeron places a driftwood crown on his head, making him King of the Iron Islands He, Aeron, and the captains seek out Theon and Yara with the intention of murdering them, but find they have fled aboard all of the Islands' best ships.

In return for offering a hundred ships and supporting her claim to the Seven Kingdoms Daenerys agrees to help Yara and Theon to defeat their uncle Euron and support Yara's claim to the Salt Throne.

She correctly assumes they have returned to King's Landing having ferried the Golden Company from Essos to fight for Cersei.

Cersei is disappointed to hear that the Company's elephants could not be brought due to the length of the voyage. Following Strickland's departure, Euron asks to speak privately with Cersei, which she rebuffs and maintains their agreement to wait until she claims Westeros Although Euron is clearly frustrated, she states that he must earn her and that she would have executed him if not for his significance, which Euron again replies with pure self-esteem. Somewhat wary and tempted by his arrogance, she permits him to lay with her.

He then asks if he was satisfactory, to which Cersei replies that she is fond of his arrogance and promptly dismisses him. Before Euron leaves, however, he promises to put a prince in her womb (unaware she is already pregnant with Jaime's child). Unfortunately, the liaison prevents Euron from his being at his ship, where Theon rescues Yara, who intends to reclaim the Iron Islands while her uncle is away.

Unlike other psychotic characters of the series, Euron is not prone to outbursts of anger or impulsive violence; everything he does seems to be for some sort of calculated purpose, though others might not be able to perceive it - such as calmly ripping out the tongues of his entire crew for no other reason than \"I needed silence\". Euron possesses an unnerving coyness to him, tranquil and detached in the face of danger and mildly playful (but never indulgent in idle whims). When walking along the rope-bridges of Pyke during a massive storm, while Balon struggled not to fall over, Euron calmly stood his ground without bothering to hold on to anything. Euron also isn't particularly arrogant, in the sense that he doesn't have a sense of entitlement - he just does what he feels like, and is self-assured in his own power and abilities. "}, {"context": "In contrast, Joffrey Baratheon was an arrogant, petty fool prone to random outbursts of anger, obsessed with the title of king he believed he inherited, even though he was little more than a puppet backed up by his grandfather Tywin. Joffrey never actually wielded a weapon, however, usually making a cowardly retreat when confronted with real danger. Ramsay Bolton was sadistic and personally dangerous, capable of great violence and torment against people he had already captured, but he didn't have any true authority to back it up, and an impulsive, childish need to brutalize people for transient amusement (i.e. hunting women for sport and flaying men alive who disobeyed him, then leaving them on public display) with no thought to the long-term repercussions. Ramsay only knew random force and was in no way skilled at diplomacy, alienating potential allies. Euron Greyjoy, meanwhile, isn't impulsive but capable of cunning long-term strategies, and unlike both of them, is actually capable of being extremely charming when the situation arises. Euron needed to win over the ironborn to elect him king willingly, playing to their admiration for strength and audacity, while making grandiose promises. In many ways, Euron is the feared ruler that Joffrey and Ramsay wished they could be: genuinely dangerous and cunning, with a well-earned reputation, the authority to back it up, and a gift for long-term manipulation. "}, {"context": "Euron's true personality, however, is in some ways difficult to pin down - he is such a master manipulator that he tailors each performance, as it were, to fit his current audience. When he wins over the ironborn at the Kingsmoot, he shifts to a more low-brow register, playing to their love of battle and crass sex jokes. When he appears before Queen Cersei, however, he shifts to a different act of a swaggering and dangerous but very witty and charming persona. His private confrontation with his brother Balon may have been one of the few times he dropped the mask and the man underneath appeared: dark and threatening, making a few bitter quips, but with an unnerving sense of tranquility while making blasphemous claims about his own power, likening himself to a god, and to the storm itself. "}, {"context": "Euron is a terrifying and relentless warrior in personal combat if the need arises, laughing while shrugging off minor stab wounds. He is a master combatant, individually killing two of the Sand Snakes and capturing his niece; all of whom were deadly warriors in their own right. Euron's fighting style was just as savage and unpredictable as he was, and he used anything (even his opponents' weapons, as he did to kill the Sand Snakes) at his disposal. Euron also roared madly when he struck down Obara, lifting her high off the ground with the broken halves of her own spear, showing that he revelled completely in the thick of battle. He was capable of being intensely sadistic, laughing triumphantly when Theon Greyjoy fled from him after Euron defeated Yara. Euron also confessed that he was hugely impressed, if not awed, by Jaime Lannister's swordsmanship during the Greyjoy Rebellion, even though Jaime had been cutting down Euron's own kin and was Euron's own enemy at the time. Despite being such a great warrior, he was willing to admit that he was afraid when he encountered a wight for the first time. "}, {"context": "Additionally, Euron is a master sailor, admiral, and a genius in naval combat. His talent in naval warfare led to much of Cersei's early advantages in her war: destroying the rival Greyjoy fleet, crushing the Dornish forces and blockading the Unsullied in Casterly Rock. With his powerful navy and brilliance, Euron may well be the greatest naval power in the world. "}, {"context": "Euron also has no qualms with other social taboos such as kinslaying openly killing his own brother to seize the throne and bragging about that in public, and flippantly announcing he will murder his niece and nephew. In that aspect, Euron proves to be worse than Ramsay: Ramsay has also killed his kin, but even he wouldn't admit that in public. "}, {"context": "Euron, like Ramsay, is pure evil. Euron is utterly psychopathic, and incredibly sadistic. He has no problem slaying his own kin, or torturing his own men. However, unlike Ramsay, Euron is highly intelligent, feared by even his own men, and capable of playing the long game to get what he wants. Euron may be one of the, if not the most evil person in Westeros.

It was Euron who came up with the battle plan for the surprise Raid on Lannisport during the Greyjoy Rebellion which burned Tywin Lannister 's entire fleet at anchor before it could respond to the ironborn's declaration of independence. Victarion commanded the actual assault itself, but followed Euron's plan.

Eurondoes show his \"bravery\" against helpless people who are unable or too weak to resist him, among them his brothers Harlon, Robin, Aeron and Urrigon;against those who may put up a fight (Balon) - he'd send others to do thedirtywork.

He has several bastard children but does not have any regard for any of them, none were officially acknowledged, and none have been introduced as named characters in the narrative. It is mentioned in passing that he brought three bastard sons to present to the Kingsmoot : only one is briefly described, a ten year old boy with woolly hair and mud-brown skin, apparently fathered on a woman from Sothoryos or the Summer Islands Euron bluntly says that he gives as much thought to the bastards he has produced as to the contents he produces in his chamber pot. "}, {"context": "In the past, whenever Euron drank too much, he would enter the bed chamber which his brothers Aeron and Urrigon shared, and sexually molest one of them, at his choice.

"}, {"context": "About three years before the Red Wedding (about one year before the first novel), Euron raped and impregnated Victarion's third wife, which drove Victarion to beat her to death in an honor killing, so he would not be put to shame as a cuckold. Euron flippantly claimed that it was not rape and he in fact seduced Victarion's wife willingly, but due to Euron's pervasive lying and mind games he may have just said this to mock his brother. Victarion would have killed Euron too, but Balon forbade it, though only because he would not have the taboo of kinslaying in his own halls. Balon still sympathized with Victarion and renounced Euron as his brother. As punishment, Balon exiled Euron from the Iron Islands, never to return, so he is not present when Theon returns to Pyke in the second novel. Victarion still deeply hates Euron and wishes him dead.

Victarion is Euron's younger brother, but while Victarion is old enough that his hair is flecked with grey, Euron's is still as black as night. Victarion's first thoughts upon seeing Euron again are: \"He looks unchanged. He looks the same as he did the day he laughed at me and left.\" Victarion has apparently been cut from the TV series, but the HBO Viewer's Guide family tree still lists Euron as older than Aeron Greyjoy - despite the fact that TV-Aeron is presented as an older priest with greying hair. Thus it might be a plot point even in the TV show that Euron's appearance hasn't changed - possibly due to the dark arts he learned in his voyages. "}, {"context": "In A Feast for Crows Euron makes a surprise return to the Iron Islands - the very next day after his older brother Balon's mysterious death. It's not clear whether Euron actually killed Balon in the books - the timing is certainly suspicious, but later at the kingsmoot Euron never confesses like he does in the show, leaving open the possibility of another assassin.

Euron is so brazen that he doesn't really care how suspicious it appeared to return immediately after his brother's death and then claim his throne, and dismisses Asha's accusations nonchalantly. It is unclear whether other ironborn suspect Euron too: nearly everyone at the Iron Islands and Westeros in general, including Aeron and Victarion, simply accept Balon's death as a fact, and the cause of death does not matter to them.

In A Storm of Swords Euron sails into Pyke and claims the Seastone Chair one day after Balon's death. Lord Sawane Botley objects, claiming that Theon is the legal heir, and Euron drowns him. Aeron contests Euron's claim to the throne by calling a Kingsmoot. Instead of a two-horse race between him and Yara, Euron has to contend with several other candidates including his estranged younger brother Victarion; who is older than Aeron. Like the TV series, Euron is the last to present his candidacy and manages to woo the Ironborn by having one of his men, Cragorn, blow the Dragonbinder.

Euron nonetheless neutralizes her by marrying her in absentia to the ironborn Erik Ironmaker - a politically wise action, as Asha is forced to admit. Only one ironborn lord outright refuses to accept Euron as king - Baelor Blacktyde, whose statement \" Balon was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all \" becomes a common saying among the ironborn. In response, Euron kills Lord Blacktyde, by cutting him into seven pieces, as a mockery of his conversion to the Faith of the Seven.

Led by Victarion, the ironborn conquer the Shield Islands Much to Victarion's anger, Euron not only takes all the credit to himself, but also takes advantage of the victory to weaken potential rivals (among them Victarion) by giving lands and titles to key followers of theirs. Euron knows that eventually the Tyrells will retake the Shield Islands back, but does not care, nor is he worried that he will blamed for that: he is certain that the ironborn will only remember his victory taking the islands and his generosity of giving them to the new-appointed ironborn lords, but will blame their loss on the Houses that try to hold them. As he explains later, he no longer needs those islands, because their capture has fulfilled its purpose in his plan.

Euron tries to dismiss those objections lightly, but the Reader'sdefiance encourages the other present ironborn, and they raise a series of objections against Euron's plan - mainly that the Reach is closer and richer. Rather than answer the captains, Euron leaves the room. Victarion muses gloatingly that Euron is a coward, and his new position is not as secure as he thinks. "}, {"context": "In a private conversation with Victarion, Euron complains that the ironborn have such low ambitions: he would bring them dragons, and they shout out for grapes. Yet he admits that the Reader's objections are correct. Therefore, he changes his plans: he dispatches the Iron fleet, led by Victarion, to travel to Essos and bring back his bride Daenerys, and in the meantime he will continue his military campaign against the Reach. Victarion, who still resents Euron, pretends to obey him, but secretly resolves to take Daenerys for himself, to spite Euron.

Euron sends his ships to raid up the Arbor, the Whispering Sound and the Redwyne Straits ; they even threaten Oldtown. Cersei assists Euron inadvertently, by refusing to send the Redwyne fleet back as long as Dragonstone has not been conquered (it is just an excuse - she secretly gloats over the Tyrells' distress, failing as usual to consider the applications of her decision); as a result, the ironborn have enough time to turn the Arbor and its neighboring islands into bases for raiding.

As he is explaining this to the Hound, Arya walks over Gendry and the two exchange friendly banter recalling their past time together. Arya then shows Gendry a drawing of an unusual weapon she would like him to craft for her. Although skeptical of her intentions, Gendry agrees.  "}, {"context": "King Robert's actual son Gendry is everything that his alleged son and heir Joffrey Baratheon was not, both in terms of physical appearance and personality. Joffrey was an arrogant, sadistic fop, with a massive sense of entitlement. He was not skilled at anything - particularly not atcombat, in which he was also a coward when faced with real danger. Joffrey's one real claim to importance was that he was Robert's son  which was itself a lie even if he himself didn't know. Gendry, by contrast, is theexact opposite: a generally humble and polite working-class blacksmith, who didn't grow up rich in a castle, and a brave and capable fighter when called to do so. He also needlessly defends the boy \"Arry\" when he sees the other recruits picking on (what he thinks is) a smaller boy. Unlike Joffrey, who thought the throne was his by right but was utterly unsuited to rule, Gendry has many qualities which would make a fine king, but he doesn't even know he has a potential claim to the throne. Growing up having to work for a living, at Mott's smithy, Gendry became disciplined, and doesn't have any of his father Robert's negative qualities of self-indulgence (in food, drink, and women). "}, {"context": "Gendry is extremely pragmatic and practical, as evidenced by his ability to understand how social standing benefits people unlike him: he understood that if he returned to Riverrun with Arya, she would be his 'lady' rather than his friend. This sets him further apart from Joffrey, who outright fell back on social standing and had massive delusions of grandeur where his own position was concerned. Joffrey accentuated his title as king to be the reason that he should get his way, whereas Gendry fought and survived for other people and was nowhere near as arrogant or temperamental as Joffrey. Also, he was surprisingly self-reproachful about his own actions, shown prominently in the aftermath of Melisandre seducing him; Joffrey was not the slightest bit self-reproachful, never blaming himself for anything even if he were the central catalyst for an incident. Joffrey would brutalize women at court, taking out his frustrations by having his guards publicly beat Sansa Stark and citing his authority as king when Tyrion Lannister confronted him about it. In a direct parallel, Gendry is polite and deferential to her sister Arya Stark when he learns who she is, worried at his behavior and insisting on addressing her with formal titles. "}, {"context": "Gendry is still somewhat self-conscious about being a commoner with a commoner's lot in life. Like many of them, he is terrified and subservient when he encounters members of the nobility, while somewhat resenting the great lords for oppressing the lower classes and tearing Westeros apart with their bloody wars. Nevertheless, he readily agrees to help the King in the North Jon Snow, both for his mutual dislike of the Lannisters and his father's past alliance with the Starks. "}, {"context": "Though he has no formal combat training, Gendry is remarkably skilled with a hammer, both as a weapon and a tool - much like his father Robert. While escaping from King's Landing, he effortlessly killed two curious Gold Cloaks with a war hammer, having inherited his father's incredible strength. This strength has been a prevalent factor throughout his life, as he commented to Hot Pie that when he strikes steel with a hammer it 'sings'. A glaring difference between him and his father is that Gendry does not love fighting, whereas Robert Baratheon absolutely lived for fighting. "}, {"context": "Gendry seems now to take some pride in his Baratheon blood, hating the Lannisters for killing his father Robert and immediately informing Jon Snow that he is Robert's bastard son, knowing his father and Jon's (adoptive) father were best friends. His personal war hammer features a design of a stag's head with full antlers on either side of the haft socket, the stag being House Baratheon's sigil. "}, {"context": "Finally, what sets Gendry so far apart from Joffrey is his immense sense of compassion and care,as evidenced from his blossoming friendship with Arya. It is clearly seen in their eventual parting in that not only is Arya clearly heartbroken, but as a result she lists the names of people responsible for him being taken, solely for the feelings and strong relationship she had with Gendry. "}, {"context": "In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Gendry is also apprenticed to master blacksmith Tobho Mott. Gendry's mother worked at an alehouse and died when he was very young. "}, {"context": "The books haven't specified if Gendry lived in the slums of Flea Bottom before he came to work for Tobho Mott. Logically, though, as the son of a tavern girl he probably wasn't living in good conditions before he began to work for Mott as a teenager. "}, {"context": "In the books, Gendry is said to resemble King Robert in his youth so closely that it is blatantly obvious to anyone who knew Robert that he is Robert's son - i.e., Eddard Stark recognizes Gendry is Robert's son the minute he lays eyes on him (in both the novels and TV series). Due to the fact that Renly Baratheon is also said to greatly resemble his older brother Robert in his youth, Gendry also bears a striking resemblance to Renly. Brienne of Tarth notices this in A Feast for Crows briefly thinking she sees a ghost. Instinctively she calls him \"My lord\", to his confusion. Looking at him closely, she notices the youth hasRenly's eyes and hair, but not his build, and deduces correctly that he is Robert's son. She is about to tell that to Gendry, but at that moment Rorge 's gangapproaches the inn. "}, {"context": "An unknown person - presumably Varys - paid for his apprenticeship to Mott. Gendry is in his mid-teens, a powerfully-built and strong lad who shows great promise as a blacksmith. He knows very little about his mother; she worked in an alehouse and died when he was little. She had yellow hair, and sometimes she used to sing to him. He doesn't bear the bastard surname of Waters, traditionally employed in the Crownlands, because he was not openly acknowledged by Robert. "}, {"context": "So far, Gendry has no idea who is his father. He once told Arya: \"I don't even know my father's name. Some smelly drunk, I'd wager, like the others my mother dragged home from the alehouse. Whenever she got mad at me, she'd say, 'If your father was here, hed beat you bloody'. That's all I know of him\". To Brienne he told that he sometimes saw Robert at King's Landing; on one occasion,he was playing near the Mud Gate when Robert came back from a hunt, and was so drunk he almost rode Gendry down. Gendry thinks that Robert was \"a big fat sot, but a better king than his sons \". "}, {"context": "Gendry was one of the bastards whom Jon Arryn and Stannis Baratheon inquired about. When asked by Eddard Stark Gendry mentions that Arryn came to see him, and asked him about his work and his mother. He also remembers that Stannis accompanied Arryn, but did not ask him any questions, only glared at him. In the TV series, Gendry mentions only Arryn. Because Stannis's involvement in Jon Arryn's search for Robert's bastards was cut from the TV series, he never met Gendry - thus when the TV series condensed Gendry with the Edric Storm subplot, Stannis met Gendry for the first time on Dragonstone, when he gruffly grabbed his face and confirmed that he looks just like Robert. In the books, Stannis already knew what Gendry looked like, but didn't seek him out because he already had Edric (though either way, Stannis realized that he was clearly Robert's son as soon as he saw him). "}, {"context": "The books clearly explain that it was actually Varys who arranged Gendry's escape from King's Landing in Yoren's caravan, in order to save him from the eventual purge ordered by Queen Cersei in which baby Barra was killed (it is not mentioned whether any of Robert's other bastards were killed too). When discussing Barra's death, Varys tells Tyrion \"There was another bastard, a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from harm's way\" - without specifying what steps he took, or why he even bothered to save Gendry. Yoren told Arya \"I was set to leave, wagons bought and loaded, and a man comes with a boy for me, and a purse of coin, and a message, never mind who it's from. Lord Eddard's to take the black, he says to me, wait, he'll be going with you. Why d'you think I was there? Only something went queer\". Gendry had no idea why he was sent away from the city, and why the Gold Cloaks were looking for him. He told the other kids \"I never did nothing to no queen...I was s'posed to be an armorer, and one day Master Tobho says I got to join the Night's Watch, that's all I know\". Gendry thought Yoren knew the reason, but Yoren never told him. "}, {"context": "In the books, Gendry stays with the Brotherhood Without Banners after Arya runs away and is captured by Sandor Clegane. Season 3 condensed several subplots from the books by combining Gendry's storyline with that of King Robert's only acknowledged bastard, Edric Storm. Edric was raised at Storm's End but was taken by Stannis to Dragonstone because Melisandre wanted to sacrifice him to the Lord of Light to ensure victory in the war, but Davos helped him escape. This subplot was instead given to Gendry in the TV series. Robert actually had multiple bastard children in the books, but only Barra is specifically mentioned to be killed after his death. The other two confirmed surviving bastards are Edric Storm and Mya Stone, a girl slightly older than Gendry whom Robert fathered in the Vale of Arryn a few years before the rebellion against the Targaryens. So far in the books, Gendry remains unaware of his parentage. In the TV version, Gendry appears to be Robert's only surviving bastard, as Edric and Mya were never introduced. "}, {"context": "Gendry formally asked to join the Brotherhood Without Banners in the novels, providing his services as a smith, and in response Lord Beric not only agreed but decided to knight him. Any knight can dub another man a knight, no matter his standing, albeit it is considered more prestigious to be dubbed by a famous knight or a king. Lowly hedge knights can dub other men as knights, but they would not be very well respected (Martin has compared it to the difference between receiving a diploma from a major university like Oxford or Harvard, and getting a diploma from a local community college - both are technically \"diplomas\"). Beric is not a lowly minor knight, however, but the Lord of House Dondarrion and though some may point out that he has turned outlaw leader during he war, that falls more into matters of opinion: swearing the vows with Lord Beric technically makes Gendry a knight. After he is knighted, he is called Ser Gendry of the hollow hill This didn't happen in the TV version, however, because Gendry was sent away with Melisandre. "}, {"context": "In the books there are no hints of romance between Arya and Gendry. In fact, Arya at first intends to kill Gendry once he discovers she is a girl, and the only reason she does not is that Gendry is armed and stronger than her. She is surprised that he is instead polite and deferential to her. The TV series didn't overtly play up a full-fledged \"romance\" between the two, though Gendry becomes one of Arya's few friends and she is pained when he chooses to stay behind with the Brotherhood. Later on in the novels, Gendry encounters Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne during their search through the Riverlands for Sansa and Arya. Brienne mistakes Gendry for his uncle, Renly Baratheon Gendry later saves Brienne from Biter by stabbing him from behind with a spear. "}, {"context": "Through his father Robert, Gendry has some Targaryen blood: Rhaelle Targaryen was the aunt of the \"Mad King\" Aerys II and her son, Steffon Baratheon was the father of Robert, Stannis, and Renly. The three Baratheon brothers were therefore second cousins to the Targaryen siblings - Rhaegar Viserys and Daenerys - making Gendry a second cousin once removed of Daenerys. This might be moved around somewhat in the TV continuity, which removed Aerys II's father Jaehaerys II, who had a brief rule and died young - to simplify his relationship with Aemon Targaryen Centuries of heavy inbreeding resulted in every other Targaryen suffering from insanity but apparently also preserved the ability in their bloodline to interact with dragons and to experience prophetic visions and dreams. Even Targaryen bastards - called \"born of dragonseed\" or \" Dragonseeds \" - were sometimes able to bond with dragons. So far in the books, Gendry hasn't mentioned having prophetic dreams, nor has he had the opportunity to interact with Daenerys'sdragons. "}, {"context": "The revelation in the Season 6 finale that Jon Snow is actually Rhaegar Targaryen 's son with Ned's sister Lyanna Stark means that Jon is actually Daenerys's nephew, and that Jon and Gendry are also blood relatives as well (as are Jon and Edric Storm). Given that Rhaegar and Robert were second cousins in the novels, this makes Jon Snow and Gendry third cousins (though again, the TV version apparently condensed this, which would make TV-Gendry a closer relative to both Jon and Daenerys).

By the time that the guards came to the bedroom, they found Helaena screaming, driven mad by grief, still clasping her child's corpse.

Jaehaerys's best friend was Septon Barth a lowborn man in charge of the library at the Red Keep whom he named as Hand of the King ; Barth was also one of the best Hands in history, and he played a role in all of Jaehaerys's great works for four decades. "}, {"context": "Jaehaerys inherited a troubled kingdom at a young age and faced significant troubles. After a troubled regency exercised by his mother and her new husband Rogar Baratheon, Jaehaerys started his rule two years after his accession by removing the advisors of the regency and choosing his own men to cement his authority. Lord Rogar and his mother were sent to Storm's End, their relationship with the King troubled by events that had occurred during the regency. He also dismissed the unpopular Master of Coin, Edwell Celtigar, and abrogated the excessive taxes he had imposed on smallfolk and merchants in the cities. However, Maegor's rule had left the Seven Kingdoms near bankruptcy and Lord Celtigar's taxes had little effect in bridging the deficit, and a great effect in increasing resentment towards the Iron Throne. Instead of installing another lord in the position, Jaehaerys turned to a wealthy Pentoshi merchant named Rego Draz. He was responsible for finding a new source of income for the Iron Throne and set not tolls and taxes on merchants and smallfolk, but instead taxed the luxury silks, tapestries and other items coveted by the nobility, bringing in much needed incomes to the Crown's finances. In addition, he took out loans from several foreign lenders, including the Iron Bank of Braavos. In later years, a settlement negotiated by Septon Barth with the Sealord, over a situation that could have led to war between the Free City and the Iron Throne, led to the Iron Bank cancelling the outstanding debt owed by the Seven Kingdoms. This effectively halved their debts and restored the Crown's finances enough for the King to turn to the projects he most cherished: a thorough rebuilding of King's Landing into a more organized city than the urban mess it had grown as, the construction of roads to link the Seven Kingdoms closer together, and a codified set of laws that would eventually supplant the local customs of once-independent kingdoms. Rego Draz (who became known as the 'Lord of Air' for his ability to restore the Crown's treasury seemingly out of thin air) and Barth were two of a circle of advisors who would remain with Jaehaerys for many years; the others included Grand Maester Benifer and his successor Grand Maester Elysar, and Good Queen Alysanne. Later, the circle would grow to include the King's two eldest sons, his 'heir and a spare': Prince Aemon and Prince Baelon. "}, {"context": "A major concern of King Jaehaerys's early reign was to heal the troubled relationship between the Targaryens and the Faith. Although the 'High lickspittle' installed by Maegor had accepted Jaehaerys's reign, anointing him personally, and continued to reign for several years, his succession was of vital importance to the young King, especially after his own marriage to his sister Alysanne. In addition to extending his protection to the Faith in return for maintaining the ban on the military orders, Jaehaerys needed a High Septon who would accept the Targaryens' Valyrian practices. A prominent candidate to occupy the Starry Sept was Septon Metayas, a member of the Most Devout and a staunch opponent of the Targaryens and the King specifically. Adding to Jaehaerys's concerns was the desire of the powerful Hightowers of Oldtown who wanted to see one of their House seated in the Starry Sept. With Septon Barth's help, the King struck a deal with the Hightowers that the next High Septon would be a Hightower in exchange for a few concessions: the first would be to support the Iron Throne's candidate and the second would be to back the Doctrine of Exceptionalism that had been circulated among the Most Devout. This doctrine enshrined the Targaryens' practices as lawful as they were closer to gods than men, their bond with dragons standing as proof of this divinity. Eventually, the new High Septon was chosen and was an exceptionalist, putting an end to the conflict between the Faith and the Iron Throne. "}, {"context": "The Nightfort was not simply abandoned during Jaehaerys I's reign, but actually visited by him and Queen Alysanne. The royal couple had made a formal visit to Winterfell in a great flight consisting of six dragons During the visit to Winterfell Alysanne grew bored, and on a whim flew north to the Wall on her dragon Silverwing (when Samwell Tarly passed through the Nightfort over two hundred years later, his mind boggled that a live dragon once stood in its courtyard). She was followed later by Jaehaerys himself. The Night's Watch had been in a serious decline for several decades, however, because ever since the Targaryen Conquest the Iron Throne had put an end to the constant petty wars which had been going on between the Seven Kingdoms for centuries. While this greatly benefited the prosperity of the new unified realm, it meant that the constant trickle of recruits from the losing sides of those petty wars dried up. Alysanne was deeply impressed with the bravery of the men of the Night's Watch, and convinced her husband to double the size of the lands of the Gift The boost of support that the New Gift gave the Watch helped stall its decline for several generations (though it was in full decline again two hundred years later when Jon and Sam joined it). At the same time, the royal couple recognized that the Watch could no longer adequately man the Nightfort, and convinced them to abandon it. A new, smaller castle was built east of the Nightfort, named Deep Lake to replace its guard over that section of the Wall (while the Watch's headquarters were transferred to the more centrally located Castle Black ). Deep Lake castle was paid for by Alysanne herself, and constructed by men that Jaehaerys I sent north.

Jaime notes that the Tyrell forces fought bravely, whereupon Olenna acknowledges warfare was not House Tyrell 's strong point. Olenna observes that Tyrion and Daenerys thought the bulk of the Lannister forces would be defending Casterly Rock against the Unsullied attack. Jaime, while pouring two glasses of wine, reveals it was a ruse, explaining that his ancestral home is now practically worthless, aside from childhood sentiment; a token garrison was left behind and the Rock's food stores were emptied before they fled. He also states Euron's Iron Fleet will have destroyed the attacking fleet, leaving the Unsullied trapped deep in Westeros at the mercy of Lannister forces. Meanwhile, the main Lannister army would be far away from the main attack, a strategic move Jaime learnt from Robb Stark 's attack at the Whispering Wood Olenna wonders why Tywin Lannister didn't just take Highgarden when Casterly Rock's mines first ran out of gold.

Olenna observes that Jaime really does love his sister, and calls him a fool, claiming that she will be the end of him, and that by the time he realizes what a disease Cersei is, it will be far too late for him.

He then produces a small phial and empties its contents into one of the glasses of wine, giving it to Olenna who then drinks it after Jaime confirms that it will be a painless death. Olenna reflects on the horrible way that Joffrey died, and the gruesome details that the poison caused; she admits that part was unintentional on her part, as she had never seen the strangler work in person before. Shocked into silence, Jaime stares at her, realizing at last who really killed his eldest son and let his brother take the blame, setting in motion the deaths of Oberyn Martell, Tywin Lannister, and Myrcella Baratheon. Satisfied at his horror, Olenna insists that he tell Cersei that she was the one who murdered her son, whereaftera furious Jaime storms out, leaving Olenna to die.  "}, {"context": "Later, Jaime coordinates the soldiers loading up the spoils of war for transport after the sack of Highgarden allowed them to seize all of House Tyrell 's substantial gold stores, which they send ahead to King's Landing first, before moving on to securing grain shipments. Jaime procures a large bag of gold coins and gives it to Bronn as payment for his services. Bronn, however, is annoyed that this isn't the full reward he was promised, which included a wife from the nobility and a castle. He then half-seriously asks why Jaime doesn't just grant him Highgarden as they need someone to rule it. Jaime waves this aside by saying they don't actually intend to hold Highgarden for long as it would be difficult for Bronn of all people to rule over hostile territory, and the war isn't over yet, so at this point he thinks Bronn should be satisfied with a more movable big sack of gold than a castle he'll have trouble defending. Bronn, however, is not amused.

Jaime agrees, but Randyll suggests flogging the stragglers to motivate them. Jaime urges that his soldiers fought well at Highgarden, however, and he should at least give them a fair warning first instead of launching right into the flogging. Jaime and Bronn then encounter Randyll's son Dickon Tarly again. Jaime asks what he thought of his first taste of battle, and he nervously claims it was glorious - only to then dejectedly admit that he was quite conflicted: House Tarly had been loyal vassals of the Tyrells for generations; he knew many of the men they killed, even hunted side by side with them. Jaime earnestly advises the young man that the guilt is not his but Olenna Tyrell 's as she was the one who chose to side with Daenerys's foreign army against Queen Cersei, so it is truly Olenna's fault they died and the fact that Dickon wasn't involved with the decision making process on either side means he shouldn't dwell on it. Dickon then outright confesses that the aftermath was horrible, notably the smell of all the fresh corpses. Bronn playfully taunts that Dickon, a sheltered nobleman, finally found out that men void their bowels when they die. "}, {"context": "Upon reaching the Goldroad by the Blackwater river, Jaime and Bronn are surprised to hear what sounds like distant thunder, until they realize it must be approaching cavalry. Jaime and Randyll shout for their soldiers to form up, which they manage to do before the enemy crests over the horizon - a massive, 100,000 strong horde of Dothraki cavalry. Bronn insists that Jaime should just leave and ride ahead to King's Landing, but Jaime insists he will not abandon his men. Bronn bluntly tells him the Dothraki will swamp the Lannister lines and Jaime is too valuable as a commander to stay and fight, but Jaime insists that they have a chance if they hold. "}, {"context": "At that moment, they hear a roar not heard on the battlefields of Westeros in over a century and a half, and look above the Dothraki horde to see a huge adult dragon heading straight for their lines - Drogon ridden by Daenerys Targaryen herself. Drogon outpaces the Dothraki, and at Daenerys's command \" Dracarys! \", he blasts a torrent of fire through the Lannister ranks in a straight line from front to back, punching a hole in their formation. The highly mobile Dothraki light cavalry immediately sweep through it and wheel around to catch those parts of the Lannister lines in an envelopment. "}, {"context": "The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll manage to rally under their leadership, however: the Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed heavy infantry, highly disciplined and battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage as the Dothraki wear less armor. "}, {"context": "The Lannister army gives as good as it takes for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch vertical holes through their lines, she switches to flanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right. Men are flash-burned into nothing but ash which crumbles upon the touch. Men are cooked alive in their own superheated armor as they struggled to rip it off. "}, {"context": "Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly. "}, {"context": "He then blasts the archer formations with fire. Jaime avoids the flames and is surrounded by enemies, but he manages to carve a path through the Dothraki with his Valyrian steel sword Widow's Wail to try to reach safety. He nearly gets attacked by a Dothraki from behind at one point, but Dickon Tarly kills the Dothraki first, saving him. Even then all is not lost - Jaime also commanded Bronn to reach Qyburn 's anti-dragon scorpion-bolt launcher, which they took with them in the wagon train for just this scenario (as Jaime cannot fire it one-handed). Bronn spots the dragon in the distance, and fires but misses. Daenerys is startled by the scorpion-bolt flying a few feet from her head, scans the battlefield, and spots Bronn on the scorpion as he reloads. "}, {"context": "Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion, who is watching the battle from a safe distance along with the Dothraki commanders, swears under his breath, calling his brother a \"fucking idiot\", angry that he's going to get himself killed. Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle; shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon lets out a blast of flame, but Bronn rushes over to tackle Jaime out of the way, saving him from certain death. "}, {"context": "They both fall into the river, where Jaime is weighed down by his armor, and sinks beneath the waters, in danger of drowning.  Jaime is pulled ashore by Bronn, who rebukes him for making such a reckless gamble. Realizing there is no chance their armies can beat Daenerys Targaryen at war, especially if she makes use of all three dragons, Jaime knows he must tell Cersei the bad news, to which Bronn suggests it may be better if he jumped back into the water. "}, {"context": "When he arrives back at King's Landing, he brings the news of their defeat, and that fighting Daenerys is suicide, only to be rebuffed by Cersei's overconfidence in the Iron Bank and the mercenaries that can be hired with the ransacked gold of Highgarden. As promised, he also tells Cersei it was Olenna who had murdered Joffrey, to her initial disbelief; however, as Jaime talks her through it, pointing out that Olenna had far more to gain from killing Joffrey than Tyrion, Cersei is forced to concede he is telling the truth, and angrily berates Jaime for talking her into giving Olenna a merciful death. Jaime insists that House Lannister will follow House Tyrell into the grave if the war continues, but Cersei, to his dismay, makes it plain she intends to fight on to the bitter end, both of them knowing that Daenerys will do the same, and is more dangerous with the victory she has just achieved. Cersei surmises to say that she would rather fight and die, as she knows she will be killed even if she surrenders. "}, {"context": "Later, Bronn brings Jaime to the catacombs of the Red Keep for a secret training session, but Jaime finds Tyrion waiting for him. Though genuinely upset with his brother, Jaime agrees to hear him out, and Tyrion explains that Daenerys is requesting an armistice to defeat the White Walkers, before continuing the war at hand. Upon returning to his sister's chambers, Jaime relays this information to Cersei. After Cersei seemingly agrees to the ceasefire, she informs Jaime she is now pregnant with his child. A stunned Jaime asks who she will say the father is. Cersei simply responds, \"You\", and the two embrace in happiness.  "}, {"context": "Jaime later accompanies Cersei to the parley with Queen Daenerys Targaryen and King Jon Snow at the Dragonpit. He spots Brienne among the Northern assemblyand the two stare at each other. Jaime quickly looks away from Brienne when he realizes that Cersei has noticed. When Euron Greyjoy attempts to derail the meeting and begins insulting Tyrion, Jaime angrily tells him to sit down. As the parley continues, proof of the Army of the Dead is shown, and Daenerys tells her story of how she saw them. Jaime asks her of the enemy numbers and he is shocked when she tells him of their overwhelming numerical superiority at around at least 100,000. When Cersei leaves the parley in outrage due to Jon's public pledge of loyalty to Daenerys, Brienne urges Jaime to convince Cersei to help. After trying and failing to do so, Jaime later wishes Tyrion luck when he arrives to do the same. "}, {"context": "After Cersei relents, Jaime wastes no time assembling the commanders of the Lannister army in preparation for the march North. He is outraged when Cersei interrupts this meeting and reveals she lied about aiding the North in the war against the dead. Jaime angrily protests that the undead are a threat to every living thing, but Cersei dismisses his concerns, preferring to let Jon and Daenerys exhaust themselves against the Night King, then have her forces deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict, boasting that Euron Greyjoy will soon ferry the Golden Company to Westeros in order to secure the Lannister position.Jaime is beside himself with fury that Cersei and Euron plotted this behind his back, only to be left reeling when Cersei accuses him of plotting with Tyrion to advance the cause of their enemies. "}, {"context": "It is in this moment that Jaime finally sees Cersei for what she really is: an insane, delusional, power-hungry and narcissistic tyrant who will betray anyone in order to secure her own dominion, no matter if her own life or the whole realm is in danger (possibly seeing resemblance of the Mad King in her). Nodding to Clegane, he tells Cersei to give the order. After a moment's hesitation, she nods and Clegane draws his sword. "}, {"context": "However, since Cersei doesn't actually speak the words, a thoroughly disgusted Jaime calls her bluff. He storms out, leaving a saddened Cersei behind him. He abandons his Lannister armor for simpler garb and departs King's Landing alone. On the ride north, he pulls a riding glove over his golden hand and notices that it has begun to snow, indicating that winter has finally come to King's Landing.

After hitching his horse near the castle, he removes the hood of his cloak to look around and sees a young man in a wheelchair staring at him, placid and emotionless, but with a knowing glare. It only takes a moment for him to realize it is Bran Stark (whom he has not seen since he threw him from the tower window). Jaime stares back in shock.  "}, {"context": "At first glance, outsiders perceive Jaime to be arrogant, cocky, cold, dishonorable, extremely dangerous, ruthless, disdainful, and sarcastic. To a large extent he is arrogant about his own abilities, but not without cause. Even all of his enemies admit that he is unarguably one of the greatest swordsmen who has ever lived with very few (such as Ned Stark, Jon Snow and Brienne of Tarth) able to match him. Jaime is unquestionably one of the greatest warriors in the world, he is an extremely lethal fighter, a highly skilled warrior, and he has incredible combat skills. Jaime's loss of his sword-hand did much to humble him, given that in many ways he was that hand and how much his self-identity depended on his incredible skills with a sword and knife. Jaime is famous throughout the world for being one of the greatest warriors of all time and for being a \"brilliant swordsman\" which he is widely feared for. Jaime does not mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt and straightforward. Much like his brother Tyrion, he typically just says what he is thinking, and has no reservations about mocking those he perceives as incompetent. Despite this, there were men that Jaime admired (like Ser Barristan Selmy, for whom he squired) and, underneath this cold and sarcastic attitude, Jaime is a very complicated man. "}, {"context": "Tywin Lannister has raised Jaime and Cersei with the principle of ruthlessness as a virtue. Yet even though Jaime Lannister often behaves unapologetically amoral, in his own warped way, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family (Tywin and his three children) aside from Tyrion who shows any hint of honor or principles, whilst Tywin claims to see family as his highest priority but simultaneously is willing to have Tyrion, whom he views as an incalculable disgrace, killed, and Cersei herself ironically sees no immorality whatsoever in anything she does. This is largely based on his arrogance and pride at being a member of the Kingsguard. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other \"honorable\" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while King Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults, because they felt bound by vows of faith and fealty - in this sense, Jaime is surprisingly similar to Sandor Clegane, since they both have powerful disillusionments about honor and nobility, yet they both frequently avoid unnecessary violence. "}, {"context": "A key difference between Cersei and Jaime is that Cersei honestly believes, in her skewed view of the world, that she is \"good\", Joffrey is a great king, and all of her enemies are \"evil\" people trying to destroy her and her children. In contrast, Jaime does not maintain any pretense of being a \"good\" or honorable man, as he has become apathetic to such concerns - this was influenced by him being hated and loathed by everyone because he killed a man who had infamously terrorized the Seven Kingdoms, opening his eyes to how people perceive goodness and honor. However, he still has some respect for the rules of engagement, as he refused to kill Ned Stark when their duel ended abruptly, since Ned was incapacitated by an opportunistic guard rather than Jaime himself - Jaime personally punished that guard seconds after the duel ended. Jaime also was capable of treating his own enemies rather respectfully, telling Ned Stark that his father and brother didn't deserve to die the way Aerys killed them, and saved Olenna Tyrell from a crueler fate that Cersei would have inevitably given her, by allowing her to die painlessly. "}, {"context": "Moreover, Jaime isn't a very politically ambitious man, much to Cersei'sannoyance, and often turns down herfrequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King, stating that the days are too long and their lives are too short. Political maneuvering is not his way, and he sees himself foremost as a soldier who when confronted with a problem takes out his sword and cuts its head off. Up until the day his hand was cut off, he had immersed himself in combat so much that it is his sole value, and when he does lose his hand, his sword hand, he loses the will to live because, thus far, he has only ever had to decapitate a problem so as not to face it again, but now he cannot wield a sword the same way ever again - he laments that he was that hand. Brienne of Tarth is quick to tirade to him about him having a small taste of a world where people have their good things ripped from their possession, and after that one small taste he gives up - she mistakes him for a coward at this point. Indeed, Jaime's lack of political thinking leads to him heatedly suggesting that either he or someone else execute the High Sparrow and his followers for manipulating Tommen - at the time, he did not quite see the long term ramifications of such an act because he was angry at the possibility of losing his only surviving child. "}, {"context": "After losing his hand and confessing the real reason he killed Aerys to Brienne of Tarth Jaime begins to redevelop a sense of personal honor once again as he reevaluates his past and future. In no small part to Brienne's influence, Jaime begins to see his father for who he really is and begins to wonder if there are ideals worth fighting for. To this end, he outfits Brienne with new armor and even gifts her the Valyrian steel sword reforged from Ice so that Brienne can fulfill her oath to Catelyn Stark Jaime himself is more mindful of the promises he makes, and eventually tries offering his solemn oath in certain circumstances, treated with understandable skepticism by the likes of Edmure Tully Jaime's new outlook develops to the point where he is disgusted with Cersei for stabbing Daenerys's faction in the back, and announces his intention to keep his own promises (although the undead horror bearing down on the Seven Kingdoms clearly has something to do with it). "}, {"context": "Jaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother, the only adult of Tyrion's immediate family to recognize how irrational it was to blame him for their mother's death in childbirth. Indeed, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others. Among the three siblings, Cersei and Tyrion can't stand each other, but they both like Jaime (both Cersei and Tyrion have acknowledged the only reason they haven't gone out of their way to seriously harm or kill each other is because Jaime would never forgive them if they did). However, in recent times, Jaime's good relationship with Tyrion was tarnished with the death of their father, and Jaime said he would kill Tyrion the next time they meet (though it is unclear if he really meant it). His relationship with Cersei has also deteriorated in the aftermath of Tywin's death since it was Jaime who set Tyrion free and inadvertently allowed him to kill their father.  Over time, however, and especially after learning that it was Olenna who killed Joffrey, Jaime comes to accept that Tyrion effectively murdered Tywin out of self-defense, a man bound and determined to execute his son; when they meet again in King's Landing, Jaime is initially hostile towards Tyrion, but deep down understands his motives and listens to him, and by the time of the parley in the Dragonpit, Jaime treats Tyrion with the same respect as before, indicating that he has at least partially forgiven his brother. "}, {"context": "Tywin was a stern man feared and resented by all of his children, ignoring Cersei for her gender and scorning Tyrion for both his stature and 'killing' his wife in childbirth. However, Jaime is on reasonably good terms with Tywin - not so much that he is \"proud\" of Jaime so much as he has the \"least shame\" for him compared to his brother and sister. Even so, Tywin is upset that Jaime willingly joined the Kingsguard, as while it is considered the highest honor for a knight, its members give up the rights to marry or inherit lands, meaning that Jaime cannot be Tywin's heir. Jaime wasn't in a position to act as a father to his biological children with Cersei, though he is generally supportive of Tommen and Myrcella. However, in sharp contrast with Cersei, Jaime isn't particularly fond of Joffrey, nor will he defend his actions the way Cersei does. He shows obvious joy when Myrcella reveals her knowledge that Jaime is her father and is happy about it, and embraces her, since this is the first time he has ever been able to show his feelings as a father to his children. He is equally saddened when Myrcella dies in his arms moments later. He also becomes enraged when the High Sparrow brainwashes his only son, and he contemplates a plan to bloodily finish the High Sparrow's schemes, even though sound judgment states that this plan wouldn't work. "}, {"context": "Jaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne twice (from being raped, then fed to a bear) from Locke's soldiers. The difference seems to be that after witnessing the depravity of the Mad King, needless violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his sister, Cersei, the woman he loved, then all of their children would be executed, so he felt he had no choice. Jaime killed his defenseless cousin Alton Lannister in order to orchestrate an escape from Robb Stark's camp, but he deeply regretted it afterwards, subtly hinting at it to Tyrion and then outright confessing to the High Sparrow about it, showing that he has a greater conscience than he is given credit for. This sets him apart from Cersei, who destroyed the Sept of Baelor and everyone inside (including their uncle and cousin) and around it, and proved unapologetic about what she had done. Jaime also was capable of reproach for the mistakes he made and their consequences, unlike Cersei: he felt guilt for freeing Tyrion because it led to the death of his father, whereas Cersei is blind to her own mistakes, which led to the deaths of her children. The upshot of this is that Jaime has no delusions about his own conscience. He is certainly ruthless when he needs to be, but unlike Cersei or Joffrey he does not act with cruelty for his own enjoyment. Quite the opposite, in fact: the very murder of Aerys that gained Jaime his negative reputation was actually an act of prevention against a potential genocide that would have engulfed all of King's Landing. "}, {"context": "Overall, Jaime is a surprisingly skilled battle commander. While he is far less intellectual than Tyrion, he inherited at least some of Tywin's ruthless intelligence, as demonstrated by his decisive handling of the siege of Riverrun; on arriving, he quickly corrected most of the inadequacies that the Freys had created, then ended the entire siege almost bloodlessly by coercing Edmure to enter Riverrun and (as head of House Tully) force his men to surrender. Previously, Jaime had won the Battle of Golden Tooth against the River Lords under Hoster Tully, which forced them back and allowed him to besiege Riverrun. He placed Bronn as his second-in-command in recognition of the man's military prowess, though Bronn followed him more out of ambition than loyalty. Jaime also learns from his mistakes; remembering how Robb Stark tricked him by leaving a small decoy force to be overwhelmed while the rest of the army moved to attack more important targets, Jaime allowed the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock (after having emptied its larders) while taking most of the Lannisters' forces south to storm Highgarden.  Even though he spectacularly lost the Battle of the Goldroad, the battle was almost decided from the start due to Daenerys having overwhelming advantage in numbers and firepower.  Regardless, Jaime quickly recognized that the only way he could turn the tide was by killing the enemy commander, even risking his own life for the sake of a chance to kill Daenerys; this demonstrates him to be a man of courage as well as military skill. "}, {"context": "Jaime seems to care about those beneath him, refusing to flog stragglers after the Sack of Highgarden, refusing to leave his men at the Battle of the Goldroad, and lamenting at how easily the Dothraki army broke his own army. Not only is Jaime a prodigal leader, but he has a good amount of common sense, as evidenced by his decision to ride north to combat the threat that the White Walkers posed to Westeros, and his utter incredulity at Cersei's refusal to contribute. "}, {"context": "There is a range of promotional images and screen captures featuring Jaime in the gallery. "}, {"context": "In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jaime Lannister is described as extremely handsome with bright green eyes and hair like spun gold. The books do not mention him suffering from dyslexia. He is a prodigious warrior. "}, {"context": "At the age of eleven, Jaime was sent to Crakehall, and served as a squire for old Lord Sumner Crakehall for four years (Jaime never served as a squire for Barristan Selmy ). While on an errand for Crakehall, Jaime visited Riverrun and at dinner every night Hoster Tully seated him next to his daughter Lysa ; Lords Tywin and Hoster were in talks to marry them. However, Jaime was more interested in talking to her famous uncle, Ser Brynden Tully a hero of his, and hearing of his exploits in the War of the Ninepenny Kings "}, {"context": "Two years later, while still a squire, Jaime won his first tourney melee. When he was fifteen, he and his master accompanied Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Barristan Selmy in their campaign against the Kingswood Brotherhood Jaime fought bravely against the Smiling Knight, although was not the one to kill him, and saved the life of Lord Crakehall from another of the outlaws. As a reward, Jaime was knighted by Arthur Dayne on the battlefield. "}, {"context": "A Kingsguard berth became vacant with the death of Ser Harland Grandison. With Jaime's approval, Cersei schemed to have him chosen, to prevent his proposed marriage to Lysa Tully, and so they could be in the capital together. Jaime was duly appointed to the Kingsguard by King Aerys II Targaryen. At fifteen, he was the youngest Kingsguard member in history. He served alongside such great and vaunted warriors as Lord Commander Gerold Hightower Barristan Selmy and Ser Arthur Dayne the legendary Sword of the Morning. Jaime's appointment infuriated his father, Tywin Lannister, as the Kingsguard take vows to serve for life, never marry, and give up the right to hold lands and titles. This meant Jaime was no longer his heir, the honor of which instead fell to Tywin's misshapen and hated youngest son, Tyrion, whose dwarfism made him unfit in his father's eyes to inherit Casterly Rock. It was the final straw in a longseries of slights made against Tywin by the King. Soon afterwards he resigned as Hand of the King and returned to Casterly Rock, taking Cersei with him, thus unwittingly foiling her and Jaime's plan. "}, {"context": "Jaime eventually realized that his appointment to the Kingsguard was not meant to honor him but to spite his father, whom Aerys was insanely jealous of, to deprive him of his heir and use him as a hostage for Tywin's good behavior, which soured the honor. Jaime rapidly became disillusioned with his new position, as he was forced to watch the various atrocities Aerys committed, forced by his vow to stand by and do nothing. "}, {"context": "At the climax of Robert's Rebellion when the Lannister armies stormed King's Landing Jaime betrayed his king by murdering him at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. He attacked Aerys on the steps of the Iron Throne, and cut the Mad King's throat rather than stabbing him in the back as in the TV Series. Robert Baratheon forgave Jaime, reasoning that someone had to kill Aerys, and he was just happy that the Lannisters were the ones who got their hands dirty instead of himself. Eddard Stark believed that Jaime should have faced justice for killing Aerys, or at least stripped of his position on the Kingsguard and made to take the black, but Robert didn't want to upset his crucial alliance with Jaime's father Tywin, his own new father-in-law. Jaime is stuck in an ironic situation: Targaryen loyalists despise him for personally killing the last Targaryen king, but even those who joined Robert in rebellion (and wished Aerys dead) often question why he didn't kill Aerys sooner preventing the loss of life that happened in the war. A small number of people don't even mind what Jaime did or when he did it, but place so much respect on honor and justice that they feel his breach of his Kingsguard vows to defend the king are a sacrilege that can never be forgiven. For his part, Jaime points out that Aerys was a madman who roasted women and babies on spits because the voices in his head told him they were plotting against him, and he has no regrets about killing the Mad King. "}, {"context": "Tywin's sister Genna remarks that her nephew Jaime isn't really like his father. Instead, she says Jaime has a combination of the qualities of Tywin's three younger brothers: Tygett's martial prowess, Gerion's sharp sense of humor, and Kevan's sense of honor. Genna insists that Tyrion is the son who inherited Tywin's brilliance and is most like his father, which she even told Tywin once, after which he didn't speak to her for six months. "}, {"context": "The early sections of the book A Game of Thrones play to the suspicion that Jaime wants to seize the throne himself, but this is later shown to be a red herring. Also, Robert names him Warden of the East despite not being an Arryn or having any relation to the noble houses of the Vale. "}, {"context": "After Jaime is captured in the Battle of the Whispering Wood, he is held at Riverrun, not taken along with Robb's army, though Robb only leaves Riverrun some time later so he can consolidate his forces. No scenes between Jaime and Robb are depicted in the books (as neither is a POV character at this point), though it is entirely plausible that the scene with Robb in Jaime's cell in the Season 2 premiere could have happened in the books, just \"off screen\", as Robb doesn't immediately leave Riverrun. At first, Jaime is held in comfortable imprisonment in a tower of Riverrun, but after a failed escape attempt, in which he manages to kill two guards and seriously injure a third before being subdued, he is chained up in the dungeon. "}, {"context": "The TV series' depiction of an escape attempt by Jaime, during which he kills Torrhen Karstark, is a very loose adaptation of events in the books. In the TV version, Jaime kills Torrhen because he was guarding his cell, which causes Lord Rickard Karstark to become enraged and demand revenge, to the point that Catelyn releases Jaime (in promise of her daughters' safe return from King's Landing) because she fears he won't live out the night. In the books, Jaime killed Rickard's sons Torrhen and Eddard Karstark at the Battle of the Whispering Wood (Eddard Karstark's death is apparently unchanged in the TV version). While Lord Karstark was certainly upset in the books, he wasn't going to go disobey Robb's direct command as his liege-lord that Jaime must remain unharmed (at least because he thought they'd execute him eventually). Catelyn's decision to exchange Jaime as a prisoner isn't rushed by pressure from within the Stark camp, but is rather due to her grief at hearing the (false) report that Bran and Rickon have been killed by Theon at Winterfell. Furthermore, she had recently been told by Cleos Frey that he only saw Sansa when he visited King's Landing, which makes Catelyn wonder if Arya is dead too. Believing (somewhat justifiably) that even holding Jaime as prisoner is no guarantee that the crazed Joffrey won't have her daughters killed on a whim, Catelyn decides that keeping her remaining children safe is what matters most, so she releases Jaime, sending him under escort by Brienne to King's Landing. Rickard Karstark only truly becomes enraged after Catelyn releases Jaime, because he never thought they'd release the killer of his sons, as well as because it is a very poor exchange to trade a prominent Lannister warrior for two girls. The TV series may have moved Torrhen's death around to make it closer to Jaime's release, instead of just mentioning that Jaime killed Torrhen at the end of Season 1 and expecting the audience to remember this over a season later. "}, {"context": "Similarly, \"Alton Lannister\" is actually a renamed version the character Cleos Frey in the books. Cleos' father is a Frey but his mother is a Lannister, and his name may have been changed because of concerns that the audience would be confused as the Freys are on Robb's side. Jaime does not kill him in the books (nor does he kill any of his kin), this is an invention of the TV series. Instead, Cleos is sent back to King's Landing again along with Brienne and Jaime, but is killed by outlaws along the way. "}, {"context": "Jaime doesn't appear during virtually all of the second novel, A Clash of Kings emphasizing that he is a prisoner of the Starks and in isolation. He only appears near the end during one chapter when Catelyn Stark visits him in his cell to release him. Dialogue from this scene in the books was split in two, so that some of it is used in the scene where she releases him late in Season 2, while parts of it were moved back to a separate meeting between Catelyn and Jaime in the Season 1 finale (it was just one long meeting in the book). During their conversation in the book, Jaime bluntly admitted that he and Cersei are lovers; that he is the father of Cersei's kids; that he pushed Bran from the window. Jaime denied any connection to the Catspaw assassin and revealed to Catelyn that the dagger never belonged to Tyrion, who could not have lost it to Littlefinger when Jaime was unhorsed by Loras Tyrell (as Littlefinger claimed), because Tyrion always bet on Jaime. Catelyn realized that Jaime was telling her the truth. Jaime also told her in detail how the Mad King executed Ned's father and brother Most of the conversation was omitted from the TV series. "}, {"context": "The full oath that Catelyn forces Jaime (while he is drunk, chained to a wall, with a sword pressed to his chest) to swear is \" Swear that you will never again take up arms against Stark nor Tully. Swear that you will compel your brother to honor his pledge to return my daughters safe and unharmed. Swear on your honor as a knight, on your honor as a Lannister, on your honor as a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard. Swear it by your sister's life, and your father's, and your son's, by the old gods and the new, and I'll send you back to your sister. Refuse, and I will have your blood \". Jaime wonders why would Catelyn trust the word of someone who has broken so many vows in his life; he figures that she puts her trust in Tyrion. He decides that he would return Sansa, and Arya as well (if she could be found); it wouldn't win him back his lost honor, but the notion of keeping his word when everyone expects him not to - amuses him a lot. "}, {"context": "Jaime then comes back to the forefront of the narrative in the third novel, A Storm of Swords even becoming a POV character, but while this can be done in a book, the TV series producers felt that it would be odd for one of the main cast members to disappear for an entire season (similarly, Daenerys Targaryen doesn't appear that much in the second book either, so the TV show padded out her storyline in Qarth ). This was partially made up for by showing more events that happened to Jaime \"off screen\", such as Robb interrogating him (in the season premiere) and actually depicting his failed escape attempt. Their primary solution, however, was to move ahead some of Jaime's storyline from the third book to late Season 2: Jaime is only released from captivity at the very end of the second book (as a cliffhanger), thus all of Jaime's scenes with Brienne leading him back to King's Landing are actually from the beginning of the third book. TV producers Benioff and Weiss insisted that they don't see each season as being required to neatly adapt each book matched to one season, but instead they are trying to adapt the story as a whole, so parts from other books will spill into other seasons as they are required, i.e. pointing out that the Jaime/Brienne scenes in late Season 2 aren't fabrications of the TV series, just moving up some scenes that actually occurred in the next book. "}, {"context": "In \"Kissed by Fire\" Jaime reveals his motivation for assassinating the Mad King to Brienne. In corresponding book scene, Jaime also says that he didn't tell Ned Stark his version of what happened because he knew Lord Stark wouldn't believe him anyway (and even if Ned believed - it wouldn't make any difference because the only thing mattered to Ned was that Jaime acted dishonorably regardless of the reason that made him kill Aerys), but he also goes on to explain to Brienne that the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the king's secrets, and he didn't want to be seen as breaking even more of his vows to King Aerys, even after his death. When Brienne calls for help for the Kingslayer, Jaime merely thinks to himself \"Jaime.

At Cersei's insistence, he had kept his distance from their children and never grew too close to them, so as not to arouse suspicion about their true paternity.

The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard! And that's all I mean to be!\".

Jaime did not pay her to sleep with Tyrion and he did not arrange for he and Tyrion to rescue her from a gang of rapists. She was in fact all that she appeared to be, a humble crofter's daughter whom they only met by chance on the road. Jaime says their father forced him to tell Tyrion that she was a whore to teach him a lesson. Enraged by this revelation, Tyrion slaps Jaime so hard it knocks him backwards. Out of spite (or perhaps in order to hurt Jaime), he lies that he really did kill Joffrey, and also reveals to Jaime that Cersei has been sleeping with Lancel Lannister and Osmund Kettleblack (in reality Osney Kettleblack), and maybe others.

Melisandre enters his office and again tries to persuade him to chase the rats out of his home, but he claims that Castle Black is now his home.

Indeed, Jon's plan is to allow the wildlings to pass the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, even from his closes friends such as Edd and Olly, but Jon's goal is actually to keep the wildlings from falling into the hands of the coming White Walker army.

Tormund agrees, so long as Jon accompanies him so that the wildlings will know it is not a trap. Jon borrows several of Stannis's ships for the journey (as he is marching inland and won't be using them).

Jon offers to share the dragonglass weapons with the wildlings and allow them to settle on land south of the Wall, if they promise to aid the Night's Watch in the coming battle against the White Walkers: even if they and all the men of the Seven Kingdoms are not enough to stop them, they can at least die fighting. Five thousand wildlings agree while the rest decide to stay, though Tormund hopes more will come around with time. However, as they are preparing to leave, they are all attacked by an army of wights. Jon fights his way to the hut to retrieve the dragonglass daggers, but he is ambushed by a White Walker. They fight for a while and Jon is almost killed until he retrieves Longclaw.

Jon is reluctant, as he has few friends nowadays, and also points out that as a maester, Sam's vow of chastity will be doubly prevalent, before finding out that Sam and Gilly have had sex already (to Jon's amusement).

The wildlings agree after Wun Wun stands up and says \"Snow\", confirming his allegiance. Jon, Sansa and Davos later accost Lady Lyanna Mormont who previously refused to aid Stannis Baratheon. Jon tells Lyanna of his friendship and service under her uncle, Jeor Mormont, while he was in the Night's Watch, though Lyanna initially refuses them, citing that Jon is a bastard and Sansa has been married into House Lannister and House Bolton. Jon reveals that Ramsay is holding Rickon hostage, and Davos manages to convince her that they need to defeat Ramsay in order to unite the North against the coming White Walkers. Lyanna agrees and supplies them with sixty-two men, the remaining force of House Mormont, promising that each will fight with the worth of ten men.

Jon however insists that this is the largest army they could possibly gather. Jon meets with Melisandre and insists to her not to bring him back if he should fall in the battle.

Ramsay appears to have no intention of hitting Rickon with his few shots but eventually, just as Jon was approaching his brother, Rickon is struck in the back with an arrow and killed. With Jon now defenseless in the middle of the battlefield, Bolton archers fire volleys of arrows in his direction with the Bolton cavalry charging at him as well. The Stark cavalry begin their charge to meet the Bolton cavalry, narrowly saving Jon from being trampled, forcing them to abandon their initial strategy of luring the Bolton army into encirclement.

Vindicated, Jon makes eye contact with Ramsay as he retreats from the battlefield, clearly satisfied by this turn of events and realizing that Sansa was right all along. Ramsay returns to Winterfell and closes the gates, confident that their opponent is not equipped for siege of Winterfell, as long as they remain within the gates, and he readies his archers. However, unexpectedly, with the help of the giant Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun, Jon's forces manage to breach the gates, and the remaining Bolton forces are defeated, although Wun Wun is severely injured by a barrage of arrows and spears, and eventually succumbs to Ramsay's final arrow, as Jon and Tormund watch on in horror, helpless to save their friend.

He then uses a dragonglass dagger to the heart to end the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in Westeros. Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the Army of the Dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the Targaryen or Northern forces in any way during the battle against the White Walkers. She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon Snow, as King in the North and Ned Stark's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three Lannisters present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the Starks and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict. Daenerys and Tyrion (who never knew about Jon's change of heart in the first place) rip into Jon over his ill-advised action, suggesting that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill. Jon responds by arguing that while such an attitude may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. While Tyrion goes to talk to Cersei, Daenerys and Jon discuss the dragons and how her ancestors caged them, and in turn become less impressive as the power of the dragons waned. Jon questions Daenerys's assertion of infertility, particularly when she admits that she never got an informed opinion about her condition from anyone except Mirri Maz Duur herself. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of all three Lannisters. Cersei has agreed to work with Daenerys, but not by keeping her troops back: the Lannister army will march north to fight alongside the Starks and Targaryens. Little do Jon and Daenerys know that Cersei has no intention of keeping her promise and that she intends to let them fight the White Walkers on their own and mop up whoever wins with the help of the Golden Company Jaime refuses to back down from his pledge to help fight the White Walkers and defies his sister-lover by traveling north. Whether he will warn Jon and Daenerys of Cersei's plan remains to be seen.

Sam realizes that that isn't true either, recalling the entry from High Septon Maynard's private journal about annulling Rhaegar's marriage. Bran expressed his doubts, but Sam reiterates the private nature of the journal and encourages Bran to use Greensight to confirm it. To his own surprise, Bran easily finds the wedding, where he sees a clearly happy Lyanna wedding Rhaegar in a Faith of the Seven ceremony before a Heart tree. Warging forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words. Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar never raped Lyanna.

Jon has trouble hanging on and nearly falls a few times. Eventually, wanting to land, Rhaegal obeys his command when he turns towards the waterfalls. Surprised, Jon mentions that it was as if Rhaegal knew his command and where to stop. When they do stop, Jon and Dany have a little private time by the waterfalls to cuddle and kiss.

He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn Stark's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Lady Stark was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor. While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he actually became good friends with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over. "}, {"context": "Like many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Samwell Tarly, Grenn, and Pyp. "}, {"context": "In many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and had a noble's upbringing. Jon was formally educated by Maester Luwin and was trained in combat by Ser Rodrik Cassel, excelling at swordsmanship. This made Jon somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black, until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits, and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows. "}, {"context": "The Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn, and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods. "}, {"context": "Jon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did), because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through. "}, {"context": "However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience of being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon far more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight. To this end, Jon chooses his family over the Night's Watch - a choice he once attempted to make when Robb marched off to war, but forsook in the past. When Ramsay decides to play a \"game\" with Rickon, Jon once again chooses his family by attempting to save his little brother's life, even at the cost of his own life and battle plans.

His uncle frustrates Jon by telling him to wait a few years before deciding, but when Eddard decides to go to King's Landing, Lady Catelyn refuses to allow Jon to remain behind at Winterfell. Catelyn was relieved because when Jon joined the Watch he forsook any right to inheritance, and could never challenge her own sons for Winterfell.

Stereotypical Fantasy heroes usually never get significantly hurt, at worst getting scars running over their eyes which make them look \"cool\". Author George R.R. Martin spent much of the books deconstructing or subverting traditional Fantasy literature stereotypes, making Westeros a gritty and realistic setting where instead of all of the main characters miraculously surviving through battles unscathed, some are horribly maimed (i.e. Jaime Lannister and Tyrion Lannister do not get dashingly roguish scars over their eyes - they outright lose their sword hand and nose, respectively).

Jon therefore had to have something to do in the earlier parts of the season. "}, {"context": "Unbeknownst to Jon, late in the third novel Robb names him as his heir: since Jeyne has not given him heirs yet, Bran and Rickon are reported as dead, Arya is missing, and Sansa was forced to marry Tyrion - the Lannisters could lay claim to the North. Robb realizes that he needs to name a new heir, because if he dies there will be no obvious successor to challenge the Lannister's claim through Sansa, and decides Jon is the best choice - given that Robb is a king, he can simply issue a decree legitimizing Jon. Catelyn pleads with Robb not to choose Jon, and instead pick a very distant cousin from House Royce but Robb does not listen to her. He signs the decree in the presence of several of his northern lords as witnesses. However, it is unknown what has become of the decree, as it is no longer mentioned in the books. It is speculated that Robb has given it to Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover, whom he sent on a mission to seek out Howland Reed (therefore they do not attend the Red Wedding), but their current location is unknown.

As for the oath: Melisandre tells Jon \"R'hllor is the only true god. A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes. Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in. Burn these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light\". Jon thinks it over, recalling how when he was very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his. Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those dreams. Now, in order to claim his father's castle, he must turn against his father's gods. The more Jon thinks about it, he grows to loathe the notion of destroying the weirwood of Winterfell. He looks at Ghost, whose white fur and red eyes remind him of a heart tree, and this is what makes him reject the legitimization offer.

Jon dissuades Stannis from taking ill-advised actions that can be disastrous to him, like granting northern castles to southron lords and the plan to attack Dreadfort (an idea brought up by the treacherous Arnolf Karstark, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons); instead, he advises Stannis to gain the support of the Northern mountain clans and to liberate Deepwood Motte from the ironborn.

Jon argues that the neutrality goes both ways, and Ramsay cannot just threaten to kill the head of the Night's Watch with impunity. Jon ultimately receives a very similar letter in the TV series, although it is after his resurrection - and unlike in the novels, Sansa is there to witness it(Sansa never married Ramsay in the novels, so this change was thrown in to increase the emotional impact of the scene - which could also explain delaying the letter until after Jon abandoned the Night's Watch).

Some stories say that he found a secret tunnel into Casterly Rock, and snuck around inside causing intrigue between the Casterlys, stealing treasures from one brother's chamber and planting them in another's to cause strife, until ultimately the Casterlys killed each other and Lann took over, and possibly finished off any survivors. Other tales say that he used the secret tunnel to infest the castle with rats and vermin, until the Casterlys fled - while yet other tales say that he managed to sneak lions into the castle, who killed several Casterlys and caused the rest to flee. The more pragmatic story is that Lann was simply a man-at-arms in the castle, who impregnated Lord Casterly's daughter, and ended up marrying the girl. Because there were no other heirs left, when Lord Casterly died Lann became the new Lord of the Rock through his child.

Writer Bryan Cogman however, subsequently did an interview with Westeros.org, and specifically addressed this concern: changes in adaptation meant that Loras had to have sex with Olyvar, to let it slip that he would marry Sansa, as part of the plot mechanics of the Lannister/Tyrell rivalry. However, Cogman explained, his earlier drafts of the episode actually included longer scenes which made it explicitly clear that Loras is not finished mourning Renly. Rather, Loras was very depressed and lonely, and in effect \"drowning his sorrows\" by engaging in casual sex in the hope that it would make him feel better, but it ultimately made Loras feel more emotionally distraught and reminded of how much he misses Renly.

The almost poetic irony here is that Petyr held Lysa in precisely that same regard, in that he had no love for her, but was very easily able to convince her to poison her husband and accuse the Lannisters of it to get the Starks and Lannisters fighting and start the War of the Five Kings, something that effectively led to the deaths of her sister uncle two of her nephews and her brother 's capture by House Frey. Due to her selfish desire to be with Petyr, Lysa effectively betrayed many of her family to their deaths, and when Petyr confronted her at the Moon Door over the subject of who he loved, he was effortlessly able to lull her into a sense of security by claiming he loved only one woman all his life until he revealed it was \"[her] sister.\" Her final expression before being thrown out of the Moon Door was shock and incredulity at it being Catelyn, before and even after Petyr ruthlessly pushed her through her own Moon Door.

In 47 AC he forcibly wed three women in a triple marriage ceremony (for a total of six concurrent wives). These three \"Black Brides\" were all the widows of men he had killed in his wars, of proven fertility because they already had children - among them his own half-niece Rhaena. Even then, his wives only bore him stillborn monsters, each of which greatly distressed him, and he descended into genuine madness. The first of these stillborn abominations was produced in 48 AC, to his second wife Alys Harroway of Harrenhal: his third wife Tyanna of Pentos convinced him that it was the product of an affair Alys had, so Maegor executed Alys, her midwives, the Grand Maester, and every member of House Harroway exterminating it. Eventually, however, Tyanna was somehow made to confess that she had actually used poison (and possibly sorcery) to produce the stillbirths in Maegor's other wives - at which he cut out her living heart with Blackfyre, and threw it to his dogs.

The histories do not confirm exactly how he died: in someversions of thetale, he was murdered by the Iron Throne, while others suspect he was poisoned. Historians consider the most likely scenario that as Maegor sat despondently on the Iron Throne in an empty hall late at night, simply waiting for the hours to pass until the rebel army came to take the city, he looked down at the still-sharp blades that made up the Iron Throne and - resolving never to be taken alive - slit open his own wrists on the throne itself, and bled to death.

Jaehaerys wisely negotiated a peace with the Faith by granting an amnesty to all surviving members of the Faith Militant if they would only lay down their arms and disband, and in return the crown would swear to always defend the Faith. \"Maegor's laws\" forbidding holy men from carrying weapons remained in force up until the War of the Five Kings, when Cersei Lannister shortsightedly rescinded them to allow the Faith Militant to be re-created.

Nonetheless he was always a brutal, ruthless man with strong sociopathic tendencies: meting out disproportionate retribution against his enemies (exterminating entire family lines if a single member failed him), and showing cruelty to animals (as a boy he killed a horse in its stable because it had kicked him). It doesn't seem that he outright enjoyed inflicting torment on random people (as the later Joffrey Baratheon did), but he would cruelly punish anyone who opposed him - and as his reign of terror spiraled out of control, his wrath led him to crush his subjects over minor slights or failures. His only response to any threat was to react with brutal force, which caused more people to turn against him in horror, which enraged him to punish them with even more brutal force, turning even more people against him, in a vicious cycle. In the last year of his reign, as his wives produced only deformed stillbirths, and more of his former allies turned against him, the stress did cause Maegor to spiral into an emotional state of near-madness and delusion. "}, {"context": "In later generations, Maegor was remembered as the proverbial tyrannical king to the people of the Seven Kingdoms: any time another potential ruler appeared brutal or tyrannical, it was whispered that they would be \"the next Maegor the Cruel\". This only stopped in the last generation, when Aerys II \"the Mad King\" terrorized the realm, ultimately leading to his downfall in Robert's Rebellion - after which the proverb shifted to saying \"he would be the next Mad King\", or when Tyrion remarks that Joffrey is on his way to becoming \"Aerys the Third\". Maegor was so controversial that even two and a half centuries later he is still best remembered as \"Maegor the Cruel\", and later generations of the Targaryen dynasty were tactful enough never to name one of their sons \"Maegor\" again (except for the mad Prince Aerion the Monstrous ).

In addition, she rather resourcefully suggested utilizing Loras in order to help conceive a child with Renly. She also showed genuine concern for Sansa Stark and tried to form a friendship with her, even offering her help to get out of King's Landing once married to Joffrey - though this may have been in part because she had the more long-term goal of good relations with the North, sensing that the unstable Lannisters wouldn't be in power forever. She shared a very strong bond with her grandmother sharing her acuity for manipulation and political maneuvering. Though she had developed many facades in order to sway the opinions of others in her favor, she was extremely loyal to her family and house, and would go to great lengths to keep them safe.Though she was willing and able to feign affection for Renly and Joffrey, she genuinely cared for Tommen (she may not have exactly loved him, but it's quite clear that she at least liked him) and bore him no ill will when he failed to stop the arrest of both her and her brother, a feeling which he reciprocated to such an extent that he willingly committed suicide when she was murdered by Cersei.

The TV series producers enjoyed Dormer's audition so much that they decided to overlook this minor difference. Thus while Margaery is the youngest of Mace's children in the books, TV-Margaery is officially a year or two older than her brother Loras - though in the male-dominated culture and inheritance system of the Seven Kingdoms (with the exception of Dorne), this does not change Margaery's place in line of succession, or significantly change her character. "}, {"context": "Margaery's true motivations are not discussed in the books, but the TV series makes her ambitions clear to the audience. This is largely due to the narrative mechanics: Margaery is not a POV character in the books (neither are Renly or Loras), and the scenes at King Renly's army camp are told from Catelyn's point of view - logically, she doesn't see the inside of Renly's tent nor is she privy to Margaery's actions. The TV series has the freedom to expand on the stories of non-POV characters, hence the apparent expansion of Margaery's character. Thus Margaery in the TV series is faithful to Margaery's actions and behavior in the books, it's just that the TV series actually depicts events which occurred \"off screen\" in the books. "}, {"context": "An interesting result of showing Margaery's POV actions is the effect it will have on portraying the sparring between Margaery and Cersei Lannister. Most of the clashes between Margaery and Cersei are shown from Cersei's POV, but Cersei is an \"unreliable narrator\". Cersei is vindictive and paranoid, and starts suspecting that anything that goes wrong in the capital, both large and small matters, must be Margaery plotting against her, or at least the Tyrell family in general. Intriguingly, at least some of these attempts to outmaneuver Cersei were objectively true, i.e. the Tyrells do try to marry Sansa to their eldest son (Willas in the books, Loras in the TV series) but how much of these plots were actually masterminded by Margaery, or simply Margaery following orders from her father Mace and grandmother Olenna, weren't entirely clear. The inner mechanics of House Tyrell's political schemes in the capital are not directly portrayed in the narrative of the books. Margaery could conceivably have masterminded some of these, while others may have been the actions of House Tyrell as a whole, though Cersei increasingly fixates on Margaery and blames her for everything the Tyrells are planning, because she fears that Margaery is the new young queen who has come to supplant her. Even so, as Cersei's paranoia increases, she starts blaming Margaery for plots which other parts of the books objectively establish that other people were responsible for (i.e. Littlefinger, Varys, the other scheming courtiers, etc.). Due to these events occurring in Cersei's skewed POV narration the books were never entirely clear about which of these were plots Margaery herself directly orchestrated (at least some actually were), and which of these plots Cersei irrationally blamed on Margaery even though she actually had no hand in them (at least some events were revealed to not involve Margaery at all). Thus the TV series may end up definitively establishing which events Margaery was or was not responsible for, when this was left deliberately vague in the novels.

After the naval battle and the death and capture of the Sand Snakes and Ellaria Sand, Dorne was left leaderless, and their army has remained in Dorne, effectively knocked out of the war. "}, {"context": "In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Martell does not play a major role in events until the third and fourth books in the series, only being referenced in the first two. "}, {"context": "House Martell was originally a tiny, obscure noble house of Dorne back when the peninsula was home to numerous small, warring states, approximately one thousand years ago. The Rhoynar refugees from a war against Valyria on the eastern continent, fled to Westeros led by their warrior-queen Nymeria, where they made landfall in Dorne and allied with Lord Mors Martell. After a brief war, Mors named himself the ruler of the unified Kingdom of Dorne, adopting the title \"Prince\" rather than \"King\" in Rhoynish fashion. Mors married Nymeria, uniting the bloodlines of the Rhoynar with the native First Men and Andals. As a result, the full name of the family is actually \"House Nymeros Martell\", with \"Nymeros\" signifying \"of Nymeria\". For example, Oberyn's full name is given as \"Oberyn Nymeros Martell\". However, even the Martells themselves do not usually use the full name, with the inclusion of \"Nymeros\", except on very formal occasions. "}, {"context": "When Aegon I Targaryen invaded Westeros, he conquered six of the seven kingdoms extant at that time, but the Dornish refused to give open battle where Aegon could destroy them with his dragons instead resorting to hit-and-run attacks which severely damaged his army through attrition. Aegon agreed to leave Dorne to its own devices after trying to conquer it again during the First Dornish War of 4 AC to 13 AC. However, the Dornish once again prevailed and the Martells managed to kill Aegon's wife, Rhaenys, before forcing the Conqueror to agree to peace on their terms. Aegon never tried conquering Dorne again. "}, {"context": "A century and a half later, Dorne was briefly occupied by the armies of King Daeron I, but overthrew them in a bloody rebellion. Eventually, roughly a century before the events of the series, Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms through a peaceful marriage alliance. House Martell's motto, \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\", directly references the fact that they were never conquered by outsiders. Because they came under the authority of the Iron Throne through marriage instead of the sword, House Martell and the other Dornish housescontinue to practice absolute primogeniture, in which the eldest child is the designated heir, regardless of whether they are male or female. Another major difference is that the rulers of Dorne are styled ruling Princes (or ruling Princesses) instead of Lords Paramount.At the time of the beginning of the narrative the current head of House Martell isthe aging Prince Doran.His daughter and eldest child isArianne Martell: despite being female, she has been actively groomed to succeed her father, as are eldest daughters all over Dorne. In his old age and infirmity (though he retains his wits)Doran has semi-retired, delegating most of the day-to-day governance of Dorne to Arianne. "}, {"context": "The Martells were loyal vassals of the Iron Throne with Princess Elia Martell marrying Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and bearing him two children. During Robert's Rebellion the Martells were unhappy with Rhaegar's betrayal of Elia by taking Lyanna Stark as his paramour and sparking a war over the matter. Still, they supported King Aerys II Targaryen 's bid to retain the throne, predominantly due to Aerys effectively holding Elia as a hostage to ensure their loyalty. The Martells lost many soldiers at the Battle of the Trident and Princess Elia and her children were brutally killed during the Sack of King's Landing by Lannister soldiers. Ironically, the Martells had only grudgingly stayed loyal to the Targaryens during the civil war, but the needless and brutal murder of Elia turned Dorne into a hotbed of pro-Targaryen sentiment (to the point that, after the Sack of King's Landing, Oberyn had wanted to continue the fighting on behalf of Viserys Targaryen ). Though House Martell swore fealty to King Robert Baratheon after the war (though this was only due to extensive peace negotiations on the part of Jon Arryn ), they have harbored anger and resentment towards the Lannisters ever since and have adopted a mostly isolationist policy ever since, not mixing with the other Great Houses unless totally necessary. As a result, the Dornish have stronger relations with the Free Cities of Essos than the rest of Westeros. "}, {"context": "The Martells and Tyrells have been sworn enemies for many generations. Over the centuries, they have fought border wars beyond count, and raided back and forth across mountains and marches even when at peace.

Knowing that an alliance between Renly and Dorne will be disastrous to the Lannisters, Tyrion take steps to prevent it by offering Prince Doran to marry Myrcella to Trystane, his sisters killer, a seat at the Small Council, and some castles on the Marches. Despite Cersei's protests, Tyrion sends Myrcella to Dorne as a token of good faith. The Martells stay neutral throughout the war, although it is unclear whether the reason is Tyrion's offer, or the Martells bide their time.

Her hatred is fueled by the fact that Oberyn fought for Tyrion at the trial-by-combat, and had come within a hairbreadth of a victory that would have allowed Tyrion to escape the blame for Joffreys murder. This is perhaps the reason for her unsuccessful scheme to assassinate Trystane. "}, {"context": "George R.R.

This leads to Cersei mocking Olenna's infamous tart-tongue. The Queen of Thorns, not missing a beat, fires back with \"the famous tart, Queen Cersei\". Cersei continues to feign ignorance about Loras's arrest. Olenna explains that while she and Tywin didn't like each other, they both understood the need for rivals to work together, particularly given that the Reach is needed to supply most of the capital's food and if that ceases, the smallfolk will not be happy. Cersei ignores everything Olenna says, only saying that House Lannister has no rivals. She then invites Olenna to the inquest into the charges about Loras (as there isn't yet enough evidence for a trial).

Conceding the point, Baelish reveals that Cersei summoned him to King's Landing for \"a piece of information he had\" his prostitute Olyvar, and he tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei: \"a handsome young man\" implied, in this instance, to be Lancel Subsequently Olenna confronts Lancel about the adulterous affair off-screen, and he is forced to give up Cersei to the High Sparrow who has her arrested.

Cersei explains that she and Olenna played right into the High Sparrow's hands by continuing to squabble instead of presenting a united front, and now the High Sparrow is planning to have Margaery do the Walk of atonement just like she did. The Lannister twins explain their plan: Olenna will have Tyrell troops liberate Margaery and Loras, and turn them over to the Crown's Justice (in this case, Kevan), for a civil trial. Kevan, in turn, will keep royal and Lannister troops away from the incident, in keeping with Tommen's orders not to antagonize the Faith.

Olenna, however, reminds Cersei that the rise of the Faith Militant, the imprisonment of her grandchildren and the compromised future of both the Lannisters and the Tyrells are all due to Cersei's stupidity. Cersei tries to win Olenna over by comparing her love for Tommen with Olenna's love for her grandchildren, to which Olenna reminds her of the smug look she gave her when Loras and Margaery were dragged away by the Faith Militant, pondering that Cersei is possibly the worst person she has ever met. Olenna bluntly tells Cersei the truth of the matter: Cersei has no friends and is surrounded by enemies with absolutely no support.

Olenna's strength and competence in politics has made her the de facto head of House Tyrell and, by extension, the Reach itself. An outspoken woman with little patience for inconvenience, she is unafraid of using her power as head of House Tyrell to threaten her enemies. Olenna never shies from stating her opinion (unless it is more advantageous to mask it) and truly hates Cersei Lannister for her cruelty, incompetence, and deep selfishness. She also admits that she finds Sansa Stark rather dull and is interested in her political potential and not her personality. Olenna stated that she did not trust Tywin Lannister, nor did she especially like him as a person, but she did respect him for his steadfast diligence, ambition and intellect - she almost praised him for the fact that he actually lived up to his reputation. Tywin apparently felt the same way about Olenna, as shewas one of the few people he ever treated as an equal  notably, when dealing with her, Tywin actually gave her his full attention and even poured her a drink,  rather than continuing with his paperwork as he did when almost everyone else  including his own children came to speak with him. "}, {"context": "Olenna is incredibly intelligent, as well as wise enough to understand that sometimes people must work with their enemies rather than constantly compete against them, which also explains why she respected Lord Tywin. On the darker side, Olenna has no problem harming children - such as when she poisons Joffrey, leading to his death in his mother's arms - proving she can be just as ruthless as Tywin or Littlefinger when necessary. However, this was not entirely without reason, as she did it in order to protect Margaery from the monster that Joffrey truly was, describing the tyrant as a \"cunt\". She also mentioned to have done or had done unspeakable things for the safety of her house and family and never regretted them since she deemed them necessary. "}, {"context": "She appears to have a very dark sense of humor and likes to mock those around her, including her own family.

Furthermore, she reveals to her granddaughter that even though she considered her husband Lord Luthor Tyrell an oaf, she genuinely loved him and struggled to accept his death. Olenna clearly is a staunch supporter of House Tyrell, despite being born and raised a Redwyne (but the Redwynes are also known as strong supporters and loyal bannermen to House Tyrell). In this regard, she is very similar to Tywin Lannister, who also places the power and prestige of his House above all else. Olenna, however, is wise to not be as ruthless or as cold as he was. She strikes a much healthier balance between loyalty to her House and affection for her family than Tywin ever did: whereas all three of his children grew to bitterly resent him, Olenna's grandchildren dote on her, and even her exasperation for Mace's oafishness is affectionate. When she shoots down Mace's attempt to speak to her and Tywin, he doesn't show offense but smiles indulgently, showing that he too dotes on her and is quite content to be under her.

Olenna has not grown reckless or despondent, however: she is ready and willing to seek revenge, and remains strategic and pragmatic about doing so. She also makes it clear that since her entire future has been robbed from her, she doesn't care about survival; she is perfectly willing to die, and exhaust the considerable resources at her disposal, if it means she can bring Cersei to justice. Indeed, when facing death she is perfectly calm and willingly drinks the offered poison after ensuring it won't be painful; before she goes, however, she reveals her part in Joffrey's death and requests that Cersei be told, a last bit of vengeance for and from House Tyrell.

However, Jaehaerys II has been officially cut from the TV continuity - which would imply that his entire generation of siblings doesn't exist either. One of the \"ripple effects\" of this change may be that Olenna's backstory is officially different in the TV continuity. Olenna actually has no sister named \" Viola \" in the novels, who was originally going to marry Luthor Tyrell. Instead, it was actually Daeron 's sister who was supposed to marry Luthor, Shaera Targaryen. Luthor didn't need to be seduced away from her, because Shaera actually didn't want to marry him either - instead wanting to marry her brother Jaehaerys II, as per incestuous Targaryen marriage customs.

He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was in large part what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening. After his fall, Bran turned towards melancholy, citing that he would rather be dead than be unable to walk, distressing Robb upon hearing Bran say so. This factor is to be expected, because Bran had a previously extremely adventurous nature and couldn't bear to be unable to continue that way. However, Bran became happier once Tyrion gave him the designs for a special saddle, since he also loved riding as much as he did climbing.

Bran was a compassionate young man, still, and pleaded tearfully when Theon ordered for Ser Rodrik Cassel to be executed. Upon meeting Jojen Reed, however, Bran proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha. He became almost unbreakably determined to meet the Three-Eyed Raven that kept coming to him in his dreams, even if it meant separating from his brother Rickon and, later on, from Jon Snow (who would have protected him at Castle Black).

Bran is disappointed by the prospect of returning to the real world. Later on, Bran expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realized that Arthur Dayne lost only because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honorable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realized that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers only to be silenced when Leaf cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action. He also shows incredulity at what his own powers can accomplish, as shown when he realizes how he is responsible for breaking Hodor 's mind in the first place.

Having become the new Three-Eyed Raven, Bran has been given access to many more events, which he explains several times, so much that Bran becomes aware of almost anything, for example the wedding between his sister Sansa and Ramsay Bolton and even the conversation between Littlefinger and Varys He also shows a rather dangerous and threatening side, as evidenced by his deadpan recital of Chaos is a ladder to Petyr Baelish, outright showing that he knows how treacherous Petyr is and what he has done against House Stark in the past, but also suggesting that Petyr is unable to manipulate him. Also, Bran shows himself to have become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him. However, Bran is not truly omniscient, as he still needs to witness events in order to find out about them, as shown by his surprise when he heard that Rhaegar and Lyanna were secretly married.

However, his strained relationship with his brothers didn't prevent him from complimenting Robert behind his back that he used to be good at killing and showing concern when he was mortally wounded by the boar.

Adding to this, he used to become uneasy around violence and blood, throwing up when a knight was maimed after jousting and even after Loras cut him to prove a point, Renly was still squeamish and treated it as if it was a mortal wound. According to him, all he heard about from Robert was how he was never \"tough\" enough, and came to resent the idea that good soldiers automatically make good kings, which was seen when Ned Stark attempted to reinforce Stannis as the rightful heir.

He became a member of Robert's small council while he was alive and forged a marriage alliance with House Tyrell to support his claim for the Throne, gaining more bannermen and strengthening his army by marrying Margaery Tyrell At the same time however, the prospect of a marriage alliance was to create a line of children, which he was was unable to do on account of his homosexuality until Margaery reformed that their marriage was only on paper. Renly was patient; for all of his zeal to obtain the title of king he was capable of waiting until Robb Stark had weakened the forces in King's Landing and take control later on. He also had some understanding of warfare tactics and planned to take Joffrey hostage after learning of his true parentage to weaken House Lannister so there would be no opposition for his titles. He was also very receptive to an alliance with the Starks and the Tullys (as he sympathized with them over the execution of Ned Stark) although he made such an alliance conditional to them swearing fealty to him as King; unlike Stannis, however, he wisely did not threaten them with retribution for not submitting, recognizing that it was Joffrey's threats and killing of Ned that had made them rebel in the first place. "}, {"context": "For all of his ambitions, Renly only attempted to assist his own claim and never neutralized those against him. He relied on Joffrey's illegitimacy, made aware by Stannis who also fought for the Iron Throne to support his right and never attempted to demoralize Stannis to his army even though, in the eyes of the Seven Kingdoms, Stannis possessed the most solid claim in comparison to Renly. He relied on his charisma and popularity for the support of his troops rather than propaganda, and disregarded the royal line of succession in favor of the rightful ruler being the best suited, which was automatically him in his opinion. Renly was also a tolerant man, as he allowed Brienne of Tarth to join his Kingsguard whereas many scorned her for her gender and lack of virtue. In addition, Renly was legitimately kind to Brienne, saving her from scorn when they first met and comforting her, and voicing to Loras that he appreciated her devotion to him.

It isn't exactly clear how widely Renly's relationship with Loras was known about, or even to what extent his friends and family knew (Robert, etc.). In the negotiation scene with Stannis, Renly tells him that Margaery came to him a maiden, Stannis replies that in his bed, she will die one. Brienne is in love with Renly and cried at his wedding. Littlefinger and Varys seem to know (due to their spy rings), and even Jaime Lannister makes an off-hand comment about it at one point.

However, in the second novel, A Clash of Kings he is described as having blue eyes. Author George R.R. Martin only noticed this error when fans pointed it out. Therefore, in a later book, Martin included a wink at his previous mistake by having a character recall that Renly had \"blue-green\" eyes, which looked blue or green depending on the light he was standing in.

Renly, on the other hand, acts diplomatically in thatmatter: he makes it clear to Catelyn that hewon'tlet Robb secede the North from the authority of the Iron Throne, but he's willing to let him rule the North and the Riverlands, and even hold the title of King in the North -but he demands Robb to swear fealty to him, and accept himas his overlord.

Rhaegar was brave, kind, and wise and most looked forward to the golden era that would assuredly begin when he would ascend to the throne.

Yet Aerys surprisingly spurned the match, saying that Tywin was still just a servant and shouldn't try to elevate his family above its station, as such a match was beneath Rhaegar. It was later believed that Aerys did this in a fit of paranoia that Tywin was trying to usurp his throne.

"}, {"context": "After the Baratheons overthrew the Targaryens in Robert's Rebellion history became biased in favor of the victors: Rhaegar became remembered as a villain second only to his insane father the Mad King, and people believed Rhaegar brutally abducted and raped Lyanna Stark and left her for dead. Even the Martells, who weren't sure what happened with Lyanna and didn't specifically care, were still upset that in either scenario, Rhaegar left Elia for another woman and dishonored Dorne. Had the Lannisters not butchered Elia Martell and her children by Rhaegar, the Martells might have kept that view, but the Lannisters' needless brutality drove a wedge between Dorne and the new Lannister-funded Baratheon regime in King's Landing. Targaryen loyalists, meanwhile - such as Rhaegar's own younger brother Viserys, in exile - developed their own skewed remembrance of events, that Rhaegar was the perfect Crown Prince, a tragic figure, and Robert was the villain of their story, seizing the throne from the rightful rulers and murdering the true heir. "}, {"context": "Ultimately, Rhaegar still remains a controversial and perplexing figure as his star-crossed romance with Lyanna Stark inadvertently led to his insane father sparking a war with half of the Seven Kingdoms. Thousands died due to Rhaegar's actions (or inaction), ending in his death, the overthrow and exile of what was left of his family, and (indirectly) resulted in the murder of Elia and their two children together.  What could possibly have motivated Rhaegar to not only elope with Lyanna, but fight a war to keep their marriage a secret, remains unknown. Rhaegar valued his forthcoming child with Lyanna so much that he even left champions of his Kingsguard behind in Dorne to defend her - living legends who could have tipped the balance if they had fought by his side at the Battle of the Trident.

The marriage of Rhaegar's parents was not a happy one, as it had been arranged by their own father Jaehaerys II (cut from the TV continuity). In Targaryen tradition, Aerys II married his own sister Rhaella an incestuous match to \"keep the bloodline pure\". It was rumored that Jaehaerys II forced the match because he had heard a prophecy from a woods witch that the Prince That Was Promised would be born of their bloodline. "}, {"context": "Rhaegar was very bookish in his youth, so that people jested that Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle while he was in her womb. As a boy, he was able to impress the maesters with his wit. He only became a warrior after reading something that changed his outlook, and from then on pursued his martial training with as much dedication as his studies. Years later, Viserys told Daenerys that Arthur Dayne was the only knight in the realm who was Rhaegar's peer; this turned out, however, to be another of Viserys's poorly informed exaggerations. Barristan Selmy later assured Daenerys, as gently as he could, that her eldest brother was a very highly skilled warrior, but he was not the invincible knight Viserys claimed he was. Rhaegar was nonetheless a very skilled knight, and was capable of unhorsing even Barristan himself in the joust. Still, Rhaegar's great love was always reading and music, preferring the harp to the lance, and he rarely participated in tournaments, because he never loved the song of swords the way that Robert or Jaime did. "}, {"context": "King Aerys's madness worsened with every passing year, compounded by the stress from a series of dead children with Queen Rhaella after Rhaegar but before Viserys: three miscarriages, two stillbirths, and three other infant sons who died in the cradle. Aerys also had many mistresses, and he lusted after Tywin's wife Joanna Lannister Nonetheless, Aerys started hypocritically blaming his wife for their dead children, accusing that such weak pregnancies must have been fathered by some other, lesser man. In time Aerys became physically abusive to Rhaegar's mother, and from her screams, it was an open secret in the Red Keep that he raped her on several occasions. All of this added to Rhaegar's grief and inner turmoil.

Rhaegar, however, was apparently deeply troubled by the prospect of turning on his own father, and passed up multiple opportunities to do so - probably hoping, like the rest of the realm, that Aerys would just die of natural causes before the situation got so bad that he was forced to make such a harsh choice. "}, {"context": "Overall, Rhaegar is described as having a kind but melancholic personality, tormented by his father's growing insanity. Sorrow was never far behind him, and he frequently brooded alone on the grief in his heart. It is said that with his harp and singing, pouring out his internal anguish, he could bring entire rooms of people to tears - even the wild she-wolf Lyanna Stark "}, {"context": "Apparently, Rhaegar read some prophecy in an arcane book about The Prince That Was Promised who would save the world from the return of the White Walkers For a time, it seems that Rhaegar thought he himself was the Prince, but later he apparently thought it would be his children: noting that \"the dragon has three heads\" (referring to the Targaryen sigil) and that \"there must be one more\" (as he comments in a vision Daenerys sees at the House of the Undying ), he seems to have been convinced that the prophecy about \"the\" Prince actually referred to three people acting together: the Targaryens had first conquered and united Westeros when led by three dragon-riders: Aegon I and his two sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya Rhaegar even named his first two children after the original trio of the Targaryen Conquest generation: first his daughter Rhaenys then his son Aegon (though in the original trio, Visenya was actually the eldest, Rhaenys the youngest). Unfortunately, the health of Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell suffered greatly during her first two pregnancies, and the maesters warned that she would not survive an attempt to have a third child. This may have encouraged Rhaegar to try to fulfill the prophecy by having a third child with another woman. "}, {"context": "Another possibility is that perhaps according to the prophecy, The Prince That Was Promised had to be sired by Targaryen and Stark parents, as implied by the phrase \"ice and fire\": the Targaryens are associated with fire (their house sigil is a dragon), and the Starks are associated with ice (they rule the North). That could be the reason Rhaegar chose Lyanna as the mother for the promised child.

Fan art of this event frequently forgets that both of them were mounted on horses not on foot - at least at first, as it is also said that Rhaegar \"sank to his knees\" when he died. In the second novel, Daenerys has two magical visions of Rhaegar at the House of the Undying in Qarth one of which is of his death: \"Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a womans name.\" - strongly implying that his dying word was \"Lyanna\". The surviving prisoners from the Targaryen side of the battle (among them Barristan Selmy) begged Robert to grant Rhaegar a proper funeral : Robert still hated Rhaegar with an all-consuming passion, but even he would not dishonor himself by refusing to grant such a basic request, and so Rhaegar's body was cremated (as per Targaryen custom, in the tradition of their Valyrian ancestors).

In the vision, Rhaegar holds baby Aegon and proclaims that he is the Prince That Was Promised and \"His is the song of ice and fire. There must be one more.

Lyanna's dying words were \"Promise me, Ned\" - words that continue to replay in his mind years afterwards, though exactly what he promised has never been revealed (i.e. just to keep her son safe, or to one day reveal his real identity, etc.). "}, {"context": "The Season 7 episode \" Eastwatch \" introduced that Rhaegar secretly got an \"annulment\" from his wife Elia Martell secretly granted by the High Septon who then also secretly officiated the remarriage of Rhaegar to Lyanna Stark While what exactly Rhaegar did with Lyanna hasn't been established by the current books, it is doubtful that he got an \"annulment\": marriage and annulment do not work like that in Westeros. In response to the episode, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, owners of major book fansite Westeros.org and co-authors with George R.R. Martin of The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, put out an analysis video in which they strongly suspected that this is actually a drastic over-simplification by the showrunners of the TV series - one that botched several basic points about how marriage works in Westeros, and only creates as many problems as it solves: "}, {"context": "No one in the history of Westeros, as described in the novels at least, has ever received an \"annulment\" for a marriage that produced a male heir already: Rhaegar had two children with Elia already, an older sister and an infant son. \"Divorce\", as such, does not exist in Westeros. Annulments are only granted for very specific reasons, such as if the marriage was never consummated, or if one of the couple was already married (as bigamy is forbidden). It is said in both the books and TV series that Sansa can have her marriage to Tyrion annulled on the grounds that it was never consummated. "}, {"context": "Another possibility is that Rhaegar could have just kept Lyanna as a mistress then legitimized Jon by royal decree - as other kings have done in the past, such as Aegon IV the Unworthy Elio and Linda pointed out that customs for bastardy and legitimization are somewhat different in Westeros from the real Middle Ages, in which the Church was more powerful than the Crown and had control over declaring a child legitimate. The books have established that the Iron Throne is more powerful than the Faith in Westeros, and kings can legitimize bastards without consulting the Faith. "}, {"context": "A major fan theory circulating for some time, which Elio and Linda support, is that rather than get an \"annulment\" from Elia, Rhaegar may have polygamously married Lyanna as a second wife. The Valyrian ancestors of House Targaryen regularly incest marrying brother to sister (or as close a relative as possible), but were also known to practice polygamy - it was comparatively uncommon, but not unknown either. Most famously, Aegon the Conqueror who invaded and united the Seven Kingdoms and forged the Iron Throne was simultaneously married to both of his sisters: Visenya and Rhaenys The Faith of the Seven in Westeros strictly forbids both of these practices, and Aegon tacitly seemed to give the promise that the new Targaryen dynasty would stop following them. Aegon's sons then tried to bring back incestuous marriages, leading to the Faith Militant uprising More specifically, Aegon's younger son Maegor the Cruel a brutal tyrant, also tried to bring back polygamy - the High Septon at the time wouldn't grant him an annulment, despite his wife being apparently barren, because she was the High Septon's own niece. Aegon's grandson Jaehaerys I Targaryen later negotiated peace in the realm, ending the uprisings, but the Targaryens were allowed to keep practicing incestuous marriages. Polygamy, meanwhile, was never specifically outlawed, it just fell out of favor, as the Targaryens were wise enough not to antagonize the Faith again by taking multiple wives (in contrast, they already had an incestuous bloodline, and who they subsequently married wouldn't change that - but they could chose not to take more than one wife). A few key hints exist even centuries later that some Targaryens wanted to revive polygamy if they thought they were powerful enough to get away with it, the chief example of which is Daemon Blackfyre a legitimized bastard son of Aegon IV Targaryen Many people in-universe believe that he launched the Blackfyre Rebellion against his own half-brother the king over his love of his half-sister, who the king sent away in a marriage-alliance. Others counter that Daemon was already married so this doesn't make sense, and his wife had produced seven sons and a number of daughters for him. In turn, this led some maesters to suspect that Daemon secretly intended to marry his sister as his polygamous second wife, and that he was powerful enough to pressure the Faith into accepting this much as they had all of the incest marriages. "}, {"context": "It is generally suspected that Rhaegar wanted a second marriage because he believed he needed to have three children to fulfill part of the prophecy about The Prince That Was Promised - that the \"Prince\" would actually be three people acting together. Elia Martell had very frail health, however, and her first two pregnancies nearly killed her, and the maesters said she would not survive another. "}, {"context": "Rhaegar annulling his marriage to Elia Martell introduces the complication that this might lead to his first two children with her being retroactively declared illegitimate (such as when Henry VIII of England ended his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, then her daughter Bloody Mary's enemies used this to argue she wasn't legitimate). While somewhat of a moot point because they died years ago, at the time Rhaegar wouldn't have wanted to risk angering the Dornish like that. Even if Rhaegar hypothetically pressured the High Septon into granting him an annulment on some false pretext or another this would greatly anger the Martells and possibly make them rise in open revolt against the Targaryens. As it happened, during Robert's Rebellion the Martell armies fought for the Targaryens because Elia Martell was a hostage in the Red Keep, and because her children with Rhaegar would one day be the heirs to the Iron Throne. "}, {"context": "Of course, in either scenario, the Martells would not have been amused: even if Rhaegar explicitly made the public declaration that his children with Elia would rank ahead of any children with Lyanna, a future rebellion could break out against Elia's children using the pretext that she had been superseded by Lyanna and her children retroactively made bastards (the legality of the situation is irrelevant - rebels only need a pretext). Polygamously taking Lyanna as a second wife might have stopped short of the Martells openly revolting, but an outright \"annulment\" of Rhaegar's marriage to Elia would much more probably be used as an excuse to disinherit her children. "}, {"context": "Elio and Linda did note that they have no idea how Rhaegar getting an annulment instead of a polygamous marriage would impact Elia's children, whether it would make them bastards or not, because there is no precedent for it - no one ever gets an \"annulment\" for a marriage that already produced children. They did point out, however, that while in real-life history this automatically rendered any children by that first marriage bastards (i.e. Bloody Mary), the same isn't necessarily true in Westeros - even for TV-Rhaegar, getting an \"annulment\" in these circumstances would be such a unique dispensation from the High Septon that, while he was at it, he might have additionally had the annulment phrased in such a way that his children with Elia would officially remain legitimate. Or, he could have just declared them legitimized by royal decree. Clearly, the change to an \"annulment\" introduced a number of complications. Whatever the case, because there is no precedent for how an annulment affects children of a marriage, Game of Thrones Wiki will not treat Rhaegar's two children with Elia as retroactively bastards, until directly confirmed otherwise by the TV series (anything else would be an assumption). "}, {"context": "Elio and Linda also speculated on why the TV showrunners would make such an oversimplification from a polygamous marriage to an annulment, and believed that Benioff and Weiss wanted to make Jon Snow unquestionably the rightful heir to the Iron Throne - when in reality, even in the books, there is no scenario under which his inheritance would not be challenged by his enemies. Rebel armies don't care about the legality of words on paper, all they need is a pretext. Even if Rhaegar polygamously married Lyanna in the books, Jon's enemies would always say that Rhaegar couldn't lawfully do that because it is against the rules of the Faith, and rebel movements would use that argument against them. As Elio and Linda point out, changing this to an \"annulment\" from Elia Martell first solves nothing : now, Jon's enemies can simply argue that the annulment from Elia was unlawful - given that she obviously produced two children for Rhaegar already including a son- and thus his second marriage to Lyanna was bigamous (and unlawful once again).

Rhaenyra had been raised as the heir apparent for years and commanded the loyalty of an inner circle of noble families very close to the crown.

"}, {"context": "The two factions during the war - one supporting Aegon and the other supporting Rhaenyra - became known as the \"Blacks\" and the \"Greens\" because of an incident that took place at a tournament some years before the war began. Aegon II's mother Queen Alicent had worn a green dress to the tournament while Rhaenyra wore a black dress. Generally, Rhaenyra was supported by noble families who had enjoyed royal favor during her father's reign and possessed strong ties to the crown, while Aegon II rallied those who had been out of favor. Viserys I had signed charters with many powerful Houses in which they swore to accept Rhaenyra as his heir, but at least some of them broke their word after Viserys died. Rhaenyra sent her eldest son Jacaerys north on his dragon to visit the Eyrie and then Winterfell At that time, the Vale was ruled by a female heiress who had inherited in her own right due to a lack of male heirs, and given that the entire civil war questioned a woman's right to rule, she and Rhaenrya were natural allies. Moreover, the Arryns had enjoyed royal favor earlier in Viserys I's reign since his first wife - Rhaenyra's own mother - was an Arryn, thus binding the two families by blood.The Starks came into the war on Rhaenyra's side in accordance with the original agreements they had made with Viserys.

He was the son who had been forced to watch his mother consumed by a dragon, and he developed a deep hatred and fear of the creatures. So many dragons had died in the war that the Targaryens couldn't maintain a stable breeding population, and the few survivors became inbred and sickly. The last Targaryen dragons - the last dragons in the known world - died during the reign of Aegon III, earning him the sobriquet \"Aegon the Dragonbane\". Aegon III married Aegon II's surviving daughter to re-unite the factions from the war, though many cadet branches and relatives of House Targaryen had been killed in the war. Aegon III ruled well, and both of his sons (Daeron I and Baelor I) became kings after him, but each died childless. Therefore, the throne later passed to Rhaenyra's youngest son, Viserys II who had served as Hand of the King under his nephews for many years. Viserys II was the father of Aegon IV and grandfather of Daeron II, and Daeron II was himself the grandfather of Aerion Brightfame Aegon V \"the Unlikely\" and Maester Aemon "}, {"context": "Rhaenyra was married twice, and had five sons. Her first husband was her second cousin, Ser Laenor\u00a0Velaryon the son of Lord Corlys Velaryon who served as Rhaenyra'sHand of the King during the Dance, and her first cousin once removed, Princess Rhaenys She had three sons by him; Jacaerys Velaryon, Lucerys Velaryon, andJoffrey Velaryon. It was widely rumored by her opponents, however, that all three were actually bastards fathered by her lover, Harwin of House Strong While this accusation was used as a political weapon, it is strongly suggested that there was some truth to it - though the matter is academic given that all three were definitely descended from the royal line through their mother, and it is irrelevant for later history because all three died without issue. Rhaenyra's second husband was actually her own uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen her father's younger brother. Daemon was a fierce and powerful warrior, and one of the most skilled and dangerous dragon-riders during the Dance. The two sons she bore to Daemon were Aegon and Viserys (who later became the Kings Aegon III and Viserys II). Rhaenyra's only daughter - carried during her final pregnancy - was stillborn; she named the dead girl, Visenya. The entire reason that Rhaenyra wasn't in King's Landing when her father died is because she was resting at Dragonstone eight months pregnant. However, when news reached the island that her half-brother had declared himself king in opposition to her, she became so distressed that she went into premature labor and her daughter was stillborn, as well as badly deformed (similar to Daenerys Targaryen 's stillborn son Rhaego generations later). Rhaenyra blamed her brother and his supporters for causing the death of her daughter, adding further fuel to her hatred of them. Rhaenyra was also supported by PrincessRhaenys Targaryen, popularly known as \"the Queen Who Never Was\" due to that fact that she held a claim to the throne after her grandfather Jaehaerys I died, but her claim was ignored and the throne passed to her cousinViserys I.

Thus, viewed head-on, the top left and lower right quarters contained a normal red Targaryen dragon on black, the Arryn sigil was in the upper right, and the Velaryon sigil was in the lower left. While her faction during the Dance was informally known as \"the Blacks\", armies loyal to Rhaenyra bore banners displaying her personal heraldry of quartered red dragons. "}, {"context": "Later histories remember Rhaenyra as pampered and arrogant. She could be charming to those she liked, but was also quick to anger and never forgot a slight. However, this does not match contemporary accounts of her character  she was referred to as \"the Realm's Delight\" without irony in her youth  and her actions in the Dance of Dragons itself. By all accounts, she was the patient one, while Aegon II - a full decade younger than her - was still very much an impulsive young man. Rhaenyra actually benefited from years of training and experience at council, skills which Aegon II sorely lacked. When Rhaenyra first learned of the coup against her at King's Landing, she actually decided against making an immediate full scale assault against the capital, realizing she would have to be patient if she was to have any hope of winning back her throne. It is strongly implied that the reason Rhaenyra is remembered as arrogant is specifically because she was a woman who intended to rule in her own right, and she actually behaved no better or worse than a man would have in her position. The problem was that in the patriarchal society of Westeros, it was seen as improper for a woman to issue firm commands to men instead of behaving submissively; i.e. instead of behaving like Catelyn Stark politely cajoling and urging male lords to do what she wanted, Rhaenyra assertively gave out orders in the manner Tywin Lannister or Brienne of Tarth would - good, sensible orders, but men were frequently offended that she did not behave submissively as a \"proper\" lady should. "}, {"context": "After the Dance of the Dragons, House Targaryen revised the royal succession laws to follow a modified and extremely strict version of male-preference primogeniture, in which female heirs are put behind all possible male ones. For example, under the succession laws of most Andal nobles in Westeros, a lord's daughter will succeed before the lord's own younger brother, but under the new Targaryen royal succession laws, a lord's younger brother will inherit before the lord's daughter. Before Rhaenyra, the first five generations of Targaryens (Aegon I, his sons Aenys I and Maegor I, Aenys I's son Jaehaerys I, his son, and Viserys I) had simply never produced a firstborn daughter before, so this did not retroactively remove an older female branch from the line of succession. "}, {"context": "During her life, Rhaenyra styled herself \"Rhaenyra of House Targaryen, First of Her Name\", but subsequent histories do not refer to her as \"Rhaenyra I\". Many felt that because Rhaenyra's own son Aegon III ended up succeeding to the throne, the dynastic claim of her faction was vindicated. However, at this point House Targaryen wanted to enforce the new strict male-preference primogeniture laws, under which the deceased Rhaenyra would never have inherited in the first place. Thus, even her own son could not retroactively consider his mother to have been the rightful ruler during the civil war. If her half-brother was not retroactively established as the lawful heir, Rhaenyra's son would have been crowned under the royal name \"Aegon II\" not \"Aegon III\", to reinforce that his uncle had not been the lawful heir. Because he couldn't do this and enforce the new strict male-preference primogeniture laws, her son had to take the name \"Aegon III\" and officially declare that his mother had only been a rival claimant, not the lawful heir.

Daenerys Targaryen later forms her own \"Queensguard\", but it isn't clear whether this is a term Daenerys made up, or if it is the proper term for the Kingsguard under a female monarch. It is known that just as Targaryen fought Targaryen and dragon fought dragon in the civil war, the Kingsguard was split, with different members joining both sides. Lord Commander Criston Cole of the Kingsguard had chosen to declare Aegon II king, and thereafter became known as \"the Kingmaker\", but he died during the civil war.

Martin titled The Princess and the Queen "}, {"context": "The succession dispute and civil war between Rhaenyra and Aegon II is analogous to the Anarchy a period in England during the early twelfth century. During this time, King Henry I's only surviving heir was his daughter Matilda. Like Rhaenyra, Matilda was quite pampered and arrogant; although she hadn't been raised as the heir apparent her whole life, after Henry I's son died in the White Ship disaster, Matilda was her father's only legitimate child. She was also the widow of the Holy Roman Emperor, one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe, and thus familiar with politics and rulership. Similar to Viserys I, Henry commanded the nobles of the realm to take oaths swearing they would support Matilda as his successor, but after Henry's death this began to crumble: Matilda's claim was challenged by her cousin Stephen of Blois, who was from a junior branch of the royal family but nonetheless usurped the throne by rushing to the capital to be crowned king. In the cases of both Rhaenyra/Aegon II and Matilda/Stephen, the resulting civil war wasn't really concerned with who the lawful heir was under different succession rights, but was truly a struggle between two major factions of nobles which had developed: those who currently enjoyed royal favor (under Rhaenyra and Matilda) and those who had not previously enjoyed royal favor (the supporters of Aegon II and Stephen). In both cases, the rival male claimant is historically considered the lawful ruler (Aegon II and Stephen), but the son of the female claimant (Rhaenyra and Matilda) ended up ruling after the male claimant's son had died (the succession of Aegon III and Henry II Plantagenet).

Catelyn says they should keep Lord Rickard hostage, and Edmure agrees, saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal.

Obedient to the laws of his father - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - Robb pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads Lord Rickard. "}, {"context": "Robb's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would: the Karstarks withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home, resulting in Robb losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at Riverrun. Robb openly admits to Talisa that she was right, and he made a mistake. Robb says Tywin Lannister realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the Northerners anymore, he just needs to wait, and let their demoralized forces unravel. When the war began Robb's army was unified around a central purpose, but now they have lost momentum, and his generals are acting like bickering children. Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms - depicting Robb's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal, Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King's Landing, and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North Talisa suggests that he try to take the fight to the Lannisters if they won't come to him, but he explains that this is hopeless. Taking the city would have been difficult to begin with, but now Tywin and the bulk of the main Lannister army, as well as a large Tyrell army, are defending the city. Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide, and Tywin would crush them within a day. Talisa suggests that he lead his army back to the North to repulse the Greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase. Robb points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home, they won't want to leave again - particularly because \"winter is coming\", and the coming one is expected to be very long, five years or more. The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war, however, so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles. "}, {"context": "Thus if Robb returns to the North, it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him. Eyeing the map with Talisa, Robb decides that if King's Landing is too strong to attack and he can't return home, his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest. Robb decides that with the main Lannister army group under Tywin now positioned all the way to the east in King's Landing, he needs to return to the Westerlands and make an all-or-nothing assault against Casterly Rock This will make the Lannisters lose face, just as Robb did when he lost his home castle of Winterfell, and bring momentum back to his army. However, with the loss of the Karstark forces, they don't currently have enough men to consider attacking Casterly Rock. The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if Robb can win back the allegiance of House Frey whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying Talisa, a political nobody, instead of one of Lord Walder Frey 's daughters.

Tywin also did not expect Robb to have the determination to send hundreds of his own men to their deaths in a feint to the east. Sansa Stark mentions to Joffrey Baratheon that Robb is known to fight with his army's vanguard and commands his forces where the fighting is thickest. As such, Robb's tactical prowess and bravery in battle results in the Northerners seeing Robb as a larger than life figure and he is quickly known as the \"Young Wolf\" for his ferocity in battle. Robb's actions create lore throughout the Seven Kingdoms that tell tales of him riding his direwolf into battle and even transforming into a wolf himself.

Robb also put honor before pragmatic political needs when he executed Lord Rickard Karstark for treason and murder, costing him the Karstark contingent from his army. Like most Northerners, Robb was more proficient as a warrior than as a politician.

Roose Bolton and his then-bastard son Ramsay Snow demand complete loyalty from former Stark bannermen and enforce their new rule by executing and flaying any who oppose. The Boltons also rally the north behind a common enemy, House Greyjoy whose Ironborn soldiers still occupy areas in the north following Robb's death. With Bolton assistance, the northerners repel the Ironborn and once again become loyal to the crown. Robb's execution of Rickard Karstark days before the Red Wedding lead the Karstarks, a cadet branch of House Stark, to abandon Robb, and over the years they continued to view him with distaste and considered the execution of Rickard to have been the ultimate act of betrayal.

Robett responds he pledged to House Stark and fought for Robb Stark but it cost the Glovers their home and many lives, due to Robb's lack of stability following his marriage to Talisa Maegyr Sansa and Jon are only able to recruit a few Northern houses and only gain a few hundred men.

Sansa's devotion to the traditional, refined \"feminine virtues\" caused friction between her and her blunt, tomboyish younger sister Arya, with whom she had a sibling rivalry. As a little girl, Sansa naively believed in the tales and epic romances in which every princess gets her honorable knight in shining armor to sweep her off her feet. Sansa was infatuated with the traditional romances about mythical figures like Jonquil and historical figures like Duncan Targaryen Her greatest goal in life was to be married to a heroic and handsome prince, sitting around with other noblewomen eating lemon cakes while gossiping about the goings-on at court. "}, {"context": "Sansa's innocent, childhood infatuation with the ideals of princesses and knights made her tragically susceptible to the manipulations of the Lannisters.

Without real cause, she blindly loved Joffrey with all her heart and trusted and admired Cersei, only for them to repay her love and trust by beheading her father before her very eyes.

Her shock at the death of her father was only later deepened at the news of how her mother and brother Robb were horrifically killed at the Red Wedding and their corpses desecrated. She was visibly elated upon hearing that Arya, Bran, and Rickon were actually still alive, and though she took mostly after her mother and had a somewhat distant relationship with Jon, she loved him all the same. She was surprised to hear that Jon had become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and Jon was the first person she turns to for shelter after escaping Winterfell, aware that he would protect her from Ramsay. "}, {"context": "Sansa subsequently escapes King's Landing to the Vale with Littlefinger, and her experiences have clearly changed her personality. She had to learn from painful experience how to lie to survive at Joffrey's court, saying one thing but meaning another and manipulating people to her own ends as best she could. No longer under constant control by Joffrey and Cersei's guards, she is in her own way beginning to mature into her own power and influence as a political force.

She also later expresses approval of what Ramsay did to Theon, now Reek, and declares she would do the same. Once reclaiming Winterfell, Sansa feeds her abusive husband, Ramsay to his own hounds, even smiling as it happened.

After Theon helps her escape from Winterfell, Sansa once again sees Theon as a surrogate brother and promises she will not let Jon execute him when Theon fears Jon will have him killed for his crimes. Sansa also becomes more compassionate and a loyal sister to Jon and apologizes for being \"awful\" when they were children. When she faces Myranda for the last time prior to her escape from Winterfell, Sansa was about to allow the psychopathic girl to shoot her so that she could die with as much of herself as was remaining. She has also become significantly more brave, courageous and is developing nerves of iron. "}, {"context": "Sansa's sufferings have made her stronger and more mature, but also more war-like. Caring less for the traditional feminine virtues she used to praise as a child, Sansa moves against Ramsay in order to take back Winterfell and the North, and outright rejects his conditions for saving her brother Rickon, knowing full well he would never keep his wordand instead tells him that he will die the next day. Her experiences with the Lannisters have enabled her to watch in grim satisfaction as Ramsay is torn apart and eaten by his own hounds. This contrasts her visible horror in Season 1 upon seeing the violence when she first arrived in King's Landing, where she is distressed at Gregor Clegane's violence against Ser Hugh and Loras Tyrell and faints when her father is abruptly beheaded in front of her.

While Jon remains a protective older brother to Sansa and likewise wants her safe, he also recognizes Sansa's intelligence and her adeptness as a leader, placing the North in her charge as his regent.

Nonetheless, they come to recognize new strengths in one another: Arya's skills as a combatant and Sansa's abilities as Lady of Winterfell. By the end of Season 7, their relationship grows stronger and they develop a new closeness as sisters.

Only in very rare occasions she temporarily steps out of her passivity, like the time she intervened to save Ser Dontos. "}, {"context": "Due to a time jump which was originally planned in the books but later dropped, Sansa is only 11 years old when the narrative begins. Author George R.R. Martin himself has said that he would have aged-up the younger characters had he initially known he would abandon the time-jump. Therefore, in the TV series' timeline all of the younger characters including Sansa have been aged up two years from the books. Thus, Sansa is 13 years old in Season 1, and 14 years old in Season 2. Keeping in mind that in medieval times, the age of maturity was lower than it is today, this younger age in the books isn't quite as unusual as it sounds, but due to the abandoned time jump, this still causes some discrepancies. For example, in the books, Joffrey's torment of Sansa doesn't have quite the same inherent sexual tension to it because they're both two years younger. Sansa directly states that she is 13 years old in dialogue from the pilot episode of Season 1. On her wedding night with Tyrion Lannister, however, she says that she is 14 years old when she should be 15 years old since two years since the pilot episode have passed. It is possible that she either simply had not reached her nameday and turned exactly 15 yet, or that she was lying to try to shame Tyrion before he took her virginity (though as it turned out, Tyrion still refused to consummate the marriage, morally repulsed at being forced to marry such a young girl). "}, {"context": "A subplot in the books which is only somewhat alluded to in the TV series is that in her desperation, Sansa starts latching onto the idea of Sandor Clegane as her protector from Joffrey or a potential source of an escape attempt. "}, {"context": "In the books, Sansa is shown to be partially responsible for her father's arrest by revealing to Cersei his plan to have his daughters leave the capital city. Given that she is only a naive eleven-year-old, and that Eddard didn't give her any explanation for why he wanted to send her away from King's Landing, she assumed he was simply fighting with Cersei over some matter of state. Still enraptured with the idea of staying and marrying Joffrey, Sansa thought that if she told Cersei she would then smooth over whatever disagreement they had. The main fault is Eddard's, for foolishly revealing his cards to Cersei, and even more foolishly - putting his trust in Littlefinger and revealing his plan to him. ThusLittlefingerand Cersei knew what Eddard planned to do and had time to prepare counter-measures, regardless of what Sansa told Cersei. "}, {"context": "Sansa technically gained the title of \"princess\" when her brother Robb was declared the new King in the North While her brothers Bran and Rickon use the title of \"prince\" among the Northerners at Winterfell, Sansa's storyline involves her being held as a prisoner at King Joffrey's court in King's Landing. The Lannisters refuse to acknowledge the North's claims of independence so they don't refer to Sansa as \"princess\". Meanwhile, Sansa is in fear for her life and is subjected to frequent beatings at the hands of the Kingsguard at Joffrey's whim, so she doesn't refer to herself as \"princess\" for fear of angering her captors. Thus her title is rarely, if ever, invoked (unless Robb and Catelyn in the Northern camp are discussing her captivity). "}, {"context": "Unlike in the show, Sansa does not befriend Shae and does not trust her. Shae does whatever Sansa tells her, butsometimes, she gives Sansa insolent looks. Sansa has no idea why Shae looks at her this way, for Sansa does not know Shae is her husband Tyrion's lover. "}, {"context": "Following Sansa's escape from King's Landing, Littlefinger takes her first to his ancestral home at the Fingers. There he reveals Sansa part of the scheme to murder Joffrey. He does not reveal certain parts of it, like why was it necessary to involve her in the plot. "}, {"context": "After being taken from the capital by Littlefinger, Sansa's hair is dyed black (as her auburn hair would reveal her identity to anyone who has ever met a Tully) and is given the alias of \"Alayne Stone\", Lord Petyr's bastard daughter who recently decided to seek him out after having been entrusted to the Faith of the Seven In the series, she is introduced simply as \"Alayne\", a niece of Petyr, who makes only a vague attempt to hide her hair; she later dyes it of her own volition. "}, {"context": "Sansa has no idea thatLittlefinger was involved in her father's downfall but knows well that he is treacherous and cannot be trusted. She reminds herself he was never her friend: she remembers him smiling slyly and whispering in Cersei's ear; whenever she was in danger, Tyrion and the Hound were the ones who saved her, not him. She knows about his part in Jon Arryn's death (Lysa reveals that in her presence) and saw him killing two people - Ser Dontos and her aunt - the latter by his own hands. "}, {"context": "In sharp contrast to the show, Sansa does not become full of confidence overnight following her aunt's death. Although she becomes slightly more involved in the political affairs, she generally remains timid, passive and obedient: she never questions Littlefinger's actions and plans; she has no idea about the current events out of the Vale and particularly in the North (except she learns her half-brother Jon has become the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch), that Edmure is held captive at the Twins, and that Riverrun is under siege ;she does not even know who currently holds her home and does not bother to ask;she does not take any actions to help eitherher uncle or her great-uncle "}, {"context": "Sansa finds her cousin repulsive. After the incident with the snow castle, she thinks angrily that even Joffrey had more spine than Robert. Still, after Lysa's death, Sansa feels sorry for him and treats him patiently as she can. At one occasion, he demands \"a hundred lemon cakes and five tales\", Sansa's patience nearly runs out and she feels like giving him \"a hundred spankings and five slaps\", but restrains herself (unlike in the show). Robert initially declares he hates \"Alayne\" (unaware of her true identity), because of his ripped doll, but with time,grows to like her. Since he was so accustomed to sleeping in his mother Lysa's bed, Robert looks for other beds after his mother's death and likes Sansa's best. Sansa wouldn't have minded if he only slept, but since he tried to nuzzle at her breasts and wet the bed during his seizures - she asked Lothor Brune to lock his door. "}, {"context": "Sansa keeps her true identity hidden whilst in the Vale. She shivers in fear when Nestor Royce inquires about Lysa, barely managing to lie that Marillion was the one who pushed Lysa to her death; she fears that Yohn Royce will recognize her (it is unclear if he does). During her time in the Vale Sansa becomes more astute in political affairs as the protg of Littlefinger, recognizing that Littlefinger's awarding of the Gates of the Moon to Nestor Royce was utilized by Littlefinger as a means of gaining Royce's political allegiance, who would have to rely on Littlefinger's continued dominance in the Vale of Arryn to retain rule in the Gates of the Moon. She also deduces that during a parlay between Littlefinger and the most powerful Lords of the Vale, namely the Lord Declarants, Lyn Corbray is secretly under the hire of Littlefinger: declaring his hatred for Littlefinger publicly to encourage any plotters against Littlefinger to approach him whilst covertly reporting back to Littlefinger as his spy. "}, {"context": "Unlike in the show, Littlefinger arranges a secret betrothal between Sansa and Harrold Hardyng, the heir to the Vale of Arryn, promising Sansa that on her wedding day they will reveal her true identity. "}, {"context": "In the sample chapter \"Alayne\", Robert tells her she should marry him. Sansa, who does not have the heart to tell Robert her negative opinion of him, gently but firmly tells Robert it is out of the question: as the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, he must wed a highborn lady and father a son - not a bastard, otherwise his bannermen will claim that Littlefinger made him do that, and put her and \"her father\" to death. In the chapter, preparations are being made for a tourney, as suggested by Sansa to Littlefinger as a means of orchestrating a meeting between Sansa and Harrold Hardyng. Sansa recognizes during the chapter that Harrold is unpleasant character despite being outwardly attractive - appreciating the fact that although Tyrion Lannister was unattractive, he was kind to her. By the end of the chapter, she seduces Harrold during a dance. "}, {"context": "Although Littlefinger does not intend to keep Sansa to himself, there are hints he lusts after her, perhaps because she resembles her mother: he occasionally gives her not-so-fatherly kisses, and once touched her left breast, while telling her \"You are Alayne, and you must be Alayne all the time.Even here. In your heart\". "}, {"context": "Sansa's season five story arc diverged significantly from that in the books. Littlefinger does not arrange for her to marry Ramsay Bolton whom she never meets, and indeed she does not even leave the Vale. Instead, she is betrothed to Harrold Hardyng, Lord Robert (Robin) Arryn's unlikely heir, should the weak and sickly Lord Robert die prematurely, as Littlefinger expects (perhaps he intends to \"help\" Robert die). His plan is to wed Sansa to Harold, and for Sansa to reveal her identity to everyone present during the wedding, in order to gain the support of the knights in the Vale for winning her birthright back. Littlefinger says nothing about the Boltons or any military campaigns, since his plans will take several years to come to fruition - the marriage cannot take place before Robert dies, Sansa is widowed and Cersei is done, and there is no way to know in advance who will hold Winterfell and rule the North at that future point. "}, {"context": "In The Winds of Winter Sansa meets Harold. She finds him attractive but immediately reminds herself the bitter lesson she learned - not to judge people by their physical appearance. He initially speaks to her rudely, calling her \"Littlefinger's bastard\", nearly moving her to tears. Later he apologizes. Sansa treats him courteously but coldly, as Littlefinger instructed her - to charm Harrold but not to look too eager. To test his honesty, Sansa asks him about his bastard daughters, and he answers openly. Harrold asks to wear her favor in the tourney, but she refuses, claiming it is promised to another. "}, {"context": "In the books, Sansa's storyline in season five is played out by her best friend Jeyne Poole who is forced to masquerade as Arya Stark. Jeyne's story is almost identical to Sansa's season five storyline, although it is not Brienne who offers Jeyne her help if she needs it. Instead, it is Mance Rayder who infiltrates Winterfell as a bard to rescue her on the orders of Jon Snow, Sansa's half-brother. Also, Jeyne never tries to escape Winterfell on her own and does not attempt to force Theon into helping her as she is mentally in a much worse state than Sansa is in while Sansa is married to Ramsay in the show. In the books, while Jeyne is being tormented, Sansa is safe in the Vale, surrounded by friendly people like Myranda Royce and Mya Stone (the elder of Robert's bastards). Sansa has no idea what has become of Arya as of ' A Feast for Crows' whereas in season six, Brienne reveals to Sansa that she saw Arya and Arya looked well.

"}, {"context": "There is a fan theory that the book scene, in which Sansa builds a snow model of Winterfell (its analogous show scene in \" Mockingbird \") is a foreshadowing that she and Jon will restore both their home and House Stark.

"}, {"context": "In Westeros, only members of noble Houses typically have surnames (i.e. \"Eddard Stark\" is actually \"Eddard of House Stark\" in full). The nobility of the Seven Kingdoms is formed of roughly five tiers, which in descending order are: the royal family that controls the Iron Throne, the Great Houses who rule entire regions, the major noble Houses, the lesser noble Houses, and the knightly Houses. The Targaryens were the royal family though they were recently supplanted by the Baratheons. Great Houses rule each of the formerly independent \"Seven Kingdoms\" - such as the Starks who rule the North, the Lannisters who rule the Westerlands, and the Tyrells who rule the Reach. Major Houses are those under the Great Houses, such as House Umber which serves the Starks, or House Redwyne which serves the Tyrells. Underneath them are the lesser noble Houses (i.e. House Poole ), and below them are knightly Houses (i.e. House Clegane ): the difference between the two is that lesser Lords still have the right to dispense justice on their lands while knights do not. "}, {"context": "Typically, if a noblewoman marries above her station into a more powerful family, she will switch to publicly using that family name. For example, \" Olenna Tyrell \" was born Olenna Redwyne, but the Tyrells are the Redwyne's overlords so she switched to use of that name. A noblewoman who married below her station would defiantly continue to use the name of the more prestigious family she was born into. "}, {"context": "Given that the Starks and Lannisters were both Great Houses of equal social rank and both former royal houses, it isn't automatically assumed that Sansa would switch to being known as \"Sansa Lannister\". The major factor is that Sansa was forced into a marriage to a similarly unwilling husband by her captors. Theirs also remains an unconsummated marriage. Such unconsummated marriages can be annulled (not automatically as Littlefinger says in the show, though), but since both Sansa and Tyrion are wanted for regicide and far away from each other - it will be very difficult, though not impossible, to annul their marriage. Moreover, the books do not specify the requirements for an annulment (whether both husband and wife must attend, who is authorized to perform theannulment, etc.), thus it is unknown how difficult it will be to annul the marriage.

This might be moved around somewhat in the TV continuity, which removed Aerys II's father Jaehaerys II, who had a brief rule and died young - to simplify his relationship with Aemon Targaryen Centuries of heavy inbreeding resulted in every other Targaryen suffering from insanity but apparently also preserved the ability in their bloodline to interact with dragons and to experience prophetic visions and dreams.

Stannis, however, ordered Shireen's instructors to focus on matters relating to good governance: geography, history, religion, and classical literature have been specifically mentioned as topics she studies, and she is an avid reader. In many ways, Shireen is receiving a more thorough education than Catelyn Tully or Cersei Lannister did.

He planned to name Davos Hand of the King after he took the Iron Throne and comforted him over the death of his son despite imprisoning him as a traitor at the time.

The prime example of Stannis's rigidity is what caused his demise. The first example of this was choosing to assassinate Renly instead of allying with him to defeat the Lannisters, a mistake that not only laid the seeds of his death, but led to the Tyrells joining forces with the Lannisters and defeating his army at the Battle of Blackwater. Later on, ignoring the loss of half his forces and Melisandre abandoning him, he continues his siege on Winterfell anyway and is quickly destroyed by Ramsay Bolton 's forces.

Stannis replied that Eddard did so on Robert's orders, and privately, Stannis was angry that Robert was more grateful to Eddard for breaking the siege than to him for actually holding Storm's End. Nevertheless,Stannis told Catelyn that he was sorry for Eddard's death, and promised her justice for his murder. Stannis respected Eddard as an honorable man, and privately understood that it was beyond Ned's control that Robert liked him more than his own brother.

One major source of criticism are Stannis's frequent statements that had the decision been his, he wouldn't have pardoned many former Targaryen loyalists as Robert did when he was crowned. Now that Stannis is trying to take the capital, he openly tells his advisors such as Davos that if he succeeds, he will clean house by purging all of the disloyal court officials, instead of pardoning them or outright letting them continue in their positions as Robert did. The irony is that while several characters feel this sentiment is shockingly brutal, it becomes increasingly apparent that there was some sense to it: most of Robert's Small Council members were disloyal conspirators who actively aided the Lannisters in killing him, putting Joffrey on the throne, and the coup against Ned Stark. Varys was always a Targaryen loyalist, Pycelle had already betrayed the previous king for the Lannisters, and Littlefinger was most loyal to himself - while keeping half the City Watch including Commander Janos Slynt bought and paid for. Stannis was actually not amiss for suspecting that they did not have Robert's best interests at heart.

His tactless attitude alienates people who could have been allies, as he did with Robb Stark: he told Catelyn, \" I am the rightful king, and your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well, \" thus ruining any chance of an alliance between himself and the Starks.

He speculates that Stannis may try to rally the storm lords or form an alliance with Dorne. Davos has a similar opinion about his king: \"It is not in Stannis to yield, so long as he knows his claim is just\". "}, {"context": "Despite what it seems, Stannis is not dominated by Melisandre. He listens to her advices and prophecies, but keeps an open mind. For instance: in the third novel, she repeatedly urges him to sacrifice his nephew Edric Storm (in the show he is replaced by Gendry), promising that it will grant him the power to wake dragons out of stone. Stannis is fascinated by the idea of riding a dragon against his enemies, like Aegon the Conqueror ; yet hetakes Melisandre's words with a grain of salt, since he is familiar with the stories aboutthe tragedy at Summerhall and the unsuccessful attempts of the nine mages from Essos Baelor the Blessed and Aerion Targaryen He also is not thrilled about killing his nephew.

Some critics were upset that Stannis seemed like a fairly negative character in Season 2, but the writers were making a conscious choice to reveal the layers to his personality gradually. In part due to time constraints, Season 2 focused primarily upon showing how stern Stannis was. By Season 3, however, the writers would then surprise the audience by showing different facets of Stannis, how he feels bound by his duty, and his odd family relationships: his wife is a religious zealot who blames herself for her many stillbirths even though Stannis does not, that he has a sickly daughter who he actually tries to treat well (despite his limited interpersonal skills), etc. as Cogman explained at length: "}, {"context": "In the books, Stannis does not travel to Braavos to get a loan from the Iron Bank beforethe battle of Castle Black.

For example:Jon explains to Stannisthat if he commandsthe Northern mountain clans to fight for him, they will look at one another and say \"Who is this man?

For example, when he returned to the Iron Islands, he expected to receive a hero's welcome for being the only living heir of Balon Greyjoy. He was both baffled and offended that he did not receive such a welcome when he landed in Pyke. Also, in order to appear like a strong, accomplished young man, he would gloat over things in an almost ridiculous way - he gloated to Osha that he was the man who captured her, even though Robb Stark fought and captured her. "}, {"context": "Beneath his confident exterior, however, Theon is insecure, weak, and unsure of himself. This stems particularly from his conflicted family allegiances. After his father's failed rebellion against Robert Baratheon, he was taken from Pyke when he was nine years old to be raised at Winterfell by the Stark family as their ward/hostage. Even though he grew up alongside the Stark children - Robb Stark and Theon considered each other best friends - Theon never forgot that he was an outsider since he was not of their blood, and would be executed if his father tried to rebel again. This outsider status weighed heavily on Theon, demonstrated when Ros and Tyrion Lannister mention it.

When Robb sends Theon to Pyke to convince his father Balon and sister Yara to help the Starks fight against the Lannisters, Balon and Yara are initially successful in using their family bond to sway Theon to their side to instead fight the Starks and not aid them against the Lannisters. Even though Theon agrees to go along with his father's plan, this still causes a great deal of conflict in Theon and he almost warns Robb of Balon's plan before deciding against it. Theon tries to become a ruthless ironborn raider to gain his biological father's approval and find a true home but the conscience that he developed living with the Starks makes it difficult for him to live up to these expectations. When he seizes Winterfell, he promises Bran that no one will be harmed if Bran surrenders - which is something an honorable northerner would promise but no true ironborn would ever do - but minutes later, Theon shatters his promise by beheading Ser Rodrik Cassel when Cassel spits in his face, an unforgivable act among the ironborn.

Maester Luwin even points out to Theon that all of this is just an act to live up to his father's expectations and that Theon himself must know that his betrayal at Winterfell is wrong. Theon resignedly admits to Luwin that he is correct, but that he can't stop because he has already come too far to be forgiven, and refuses to join the Night's Watch, where all of his crimes would be forgiven, out of shame (and partially out of fear that Jon Snow might kill him in retribution for allegedly murdering Bran and Rickon). It is only after Theon becomes a prisoner of the Boltons and realizes that his father has no intention of rescuing him that he admits to himself and to Ramsay Snow that Ned Stark was his \"real father\" and laments Ned's execution in King's Landing. "}, {"context": "After being tortured by Ramsay Snow in the dungeons of the Dreadfort for over a year, Theon's original personality has been seemingly obliterated, and he is little more than a broken and half-insane prisoner. Among various tortures, Ramsay cut off several of his fingers and toes, flayed off sections of his skin, and even had Myranda and Violet arouse Theon in order to castrate him. Ramsay even mockingly renamed him \"Reek\", physically and psychologically coercingTheon intodenying his identity as \"Theon Greyjoy\" and accepting \"Reek\" as his new name and identity. Ramsay also psychologically tortured him with fake escape attempts or promises of rescue, before recapturing him. As a result, Reek thinks any possibility of escape or fighting back against Ramsay is simply another ruse. He lives in great fear of Ramsay, desperate to avoid angering him and is in such a state of traumatic shock that he is very withdrawn and submissive. "}, {"context": "However, despite his previous actions, Reek appears to have retained a strong love and loyalty to the remaining Starks, demonstrated on several occasions: he is visibly shocked when Ramsay gloats about Robb's death, briefly holding a razor to Ramsay's neck and appearing on the verge of slitting his throat (though he doesn't, because Roose and Locke are present); he appears hesitant about telling them that Bran and Rickon may be sheltering at Castle Black with Jon Snow, knowing that it may lead to their deaths, but does so anyway to avoid angering Ramsay; he silently cries and briefly looks angry when Ramsay rapes Sansa, and does his best (or what he thinks is the best) to keep Sansa from angering Ramsay and suffering more at his hands, and even goes as far as to confess to Sansa that he deserved what he suffered under Ramsay and that he deserved to be Reek for what he did to the Stark family. However, when pushed too far, Theon ultimately abandons his Reek persona and chooses his loyalty to the Starks over Ramsay, by killing Myranda and helping Sansa escape from Winterfell, though still believing himself unworthy of anyone's forgiveness for betraying the Starks, who were the only ones who ever treated him like family. "}, {"context": "Despite this admission, Theon still expresses shock after learning of his father's death when he returns to the Iron Islands. Though his sister Yara is still angry with him for refusing to be rescued, they reconcile when Theon offers to support Yara's claim to the Salt Throne While initially despondent, Theon regains some of his confidence during the Kingsmoot to select the next ruler of the Iron Islands. Giving a brief rousing speech, he manages to convince many of the gathered Ironborn to join him in supporting his sister's claim to the Salt Throne, his speaking skills demonstrating that the original Theon Greyjoy is starting to resurface, though he and Yara are outmaneuvered by Euron, who wins many over by offering to seal an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen "}, {"context": "After escaping Euron with his sister Yara, Theon slides back into his despondent state and is troubled by his role in the death of the orphan boys; believing that he should hang for his crimes. Yara counsels him to rediscover himself so that they can secure an alliance with Daenerys and retake the Iron Islands from their uncle Euron. While negotiating with Daenerys, Theon does not display reluctance for the ironborn to cease raping, pillaging and reaving, and nods at Yara to tell her to agree with Daenerys, demonstrating that despite his recovery, he is still greatly traumatized by his torture by Ramsay, and apparently wishes to lead a more peaceful life in order to prevent it from happening again. "}, {"context": "By the time of the alliance between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, Theon has shown himself to have changed with one particular act: he fought Harrag over the next move of the surviving ironborn. This act shows: Theon, who once demanded the respect of the ironborn he had not earned when he first returned to Pyke, approaches the ironborn as an equal and attempts to rally them to rescue Yara; he was willing to admit publicly that he was a coward to flee from Euron, something he never would have done previously; furthermore, Theon will fight to the death over what he believes, instead of fleeing or submitting as he has in the past. Even though Harrag was significantly stronger than him, he continued to fight, and when Harrag loses his advantage Theon seizes his chance and overpowers him, finally earning the respect of his sister's warriors. This shows that the Theon who betrayed House Stark, as well as the Reek who was a prisoner and lapdog of Ramsay Bolton, is dead and gone, and that the new Theon Greyjoy stands in his place, a brave and strong man willing to fight for what he believes in.

His true feelings toward Eddard Stark are revealed in his first POV chapter in the second novel, \"A Clash of Kings\" : he muses that Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time, but to Theon, Eddard had always remained the man who'd brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home. As a boy, Theon had lived in fear of Eddard's stern face and great dark sword In \"A Dance with Dragons\"Theon recalls that as a boy, he once hoped that he would be betrothed to Sansa so Ned could claim him as a legal son, but that was just a child's fancy.

Moreover, his late brothers Rodrik and Maron used to bully him. Generally, his living conditions among the Starks were better conditions. Eddard spanked Theon only once after he bumped into Old Nan and knocked her to the floor, and that was almost tender in comparison to the beatings he used to receive from his brothers. "}, {"context": "Soon after Theon is out of the Starks' control, he shows his true colors (in sharp contrast with his \"sugarcoated\" portrayal in the TV show): a ruthless sociopath villain, rapist and mass murderer, who has no qualms about harming innocent people simply because they are weak and defenceless, including small children ; in short, the kind of villain the Mountain is.

His statement about inheritance rights is scornfully dismissed as \"the laws of the green lands\" (which do not bind the ironborn) by his uncle Aeron, father and sister. Theon realizes that he is considered not only as a foreigner among the ironborn, but worse -as a soft boy from the green lands. Dagmer is the only one who treats him fondly; he explains to Theon that his father does not know him well, since without his three sons - Asha was his only solace, and he got used to rely on her. He encourages Theon by claiming that there will be other wars, and he shall do great deeds. "}, {"context": "Theon's initial raid at Stony Shore is the start of the overall ironborn invasion. The outcome is luridly described: bodies have been looted and mutilated. Of the fishing village, nothing remained but cold ashes that stank when it rained.

Filled with disdain at Theon's arrogance and the way he treated Beth, Rodrik called Theon a \"viper\" and \"Theon Turncloak\" (the latter phrase has become Theon's derogatory nickname). Theon threatened to hang Beth and an additional hostage every dawn and dusk. Returning to Winterfell, he was aware of his hopeless situation: hanging Beth would provoke the storming of Winterfell, and failing to hang her would hollow out future threats. Maester Luwin suggested to Theon that he surrender and take the black. Theon liked this suggestion, albeit not as the selfless act of redemption as Luwin intended. Instead, Theon fancied himself becoming the chief of rangers,or even the glorified Lord Commander. As Lord Commander, Theon believed he could captain ships, and have sex with many wildling women. While he reminded himself thatBenjen Stark and Jon Snowboth voluntarily joined the Watch, he fails to consider that Jon might kill him for the latter's atrocities.

Without provocation, Ramsay punched Theon with a mailed fist so hard that it broke his jaw, then ordered his men to kill the remaining ironborn, as well as the Stark servants and commoners of the castle, and to burn everything. As he faded out of consciousness, Theon watched helplessly as the Dreadfort soldiers killed Black Lorren and Maester Luwin The last thing he saw was his horse Smiler, screaming and rearing, his mane onfire.

ThusTheonunwittingly serves as acatalyst of the Red Wedding, although he hasno idea of it and it has never been his intention (very similarly to the way Ramsay unwittingly serves as a catalyst ofthe mutiny at Castle Black in the novels, by sending the Bastard Letter ).

Roose shows them a piece of skin, claiming it is from the little finger of Theon's left hand, which Ramsay enclosed to the letter Roose received from him. Robb says sharply that he wants Theon's head, not his skin. Roose suggests to keep Theon alive until the North is liberated from the ironborn in order to demand concessions from them, and Robb reluctantly agrees. Since Roose turns to be a traitor and most of his report is revealed to be false, it is unclear to the readers if he lied about Theon too. "}, {"context": "In A Feast for Crows Theon is mentioned several times. Most of the ironborn, including his sister Asha presume he is dead, but are uncertain since his body was never found. Ramsay never sends a taunting letter to Balon in the books, so no one knows if he is even alive, or if he is, where he is being held. Ramsay does send a warning message to Asha, to which he encloses a piece of Theon's skin (not any body part) without specifying Theon's status, but it happens much later. Neither Asha nor anyone else ever intend to try to rescue him. Asha herself actually did return to Winterfell with a few soldiers after the Bolton army withdrew, in the hope that Theon may have survived by hiding, but all they found were badly mutilated bodies, which convinced Asha that Theon was probably dead. Even if she knew that he was alive, and specifically at the Dreadfort, the Boltons' castle is so strong (and located on the other side of the entire continent) that it was actually logistically impossible to mount an assault on it with a few longships.

Theon's torture by Ramsay is only revealed in flashbacks throughout the fifth novel, but the TV series chose to present these events in the chronological order that they happened. Had they done it in the order that the books did, Theon would have disappeared after the Season 2 finale, and only reappeared again in the Season 5 premiere. The books don't directly state that Ramsay castrated Theon, though it was vaguely implied that he had. "}, {"context": "Ramsay's torture of Theon serves no real logical purpose, and he is only doing it out of pure sadism. He basically just picked Theon at random - indeed, part of Ramsay's sadistic glee in torturing people is outright gloating that it isn't happening for any reason whatsoever. The only possible reason to keep Theon alive instead of simply killing him, but not inform the ironborn that he was held captive, might have been to throw the ironborn into internal conflict over who exactly Balon's heir was (as both Asha and Theon's uncles felt they were actually Balon's heirs, due to the unusual succession laws in the Iron Islands). Even if Ramsay emasculated Theon in the books, this doesn't necessarily mean that he cannot \"further the Greyjoy line\". Unlike the honorable Robb Stark or Jon Snow, Theon greatly enjoyed having sex with prostitutes (as also seen in the TV continuity when he has sex with Ros); Theon has at times mockingly remarked that he may have bastard children that he doesn't know about. He also had sex with the Captain's daughter in the books (who outright wanted him to take her as his salt wife ), and specifically joked to her that if she became pregnant, it would be an honor to have a future king's bastard. So far in the books, however, there has been no mention of Theon fathering any known bastards. "}, {"context": "Theon's story is largely the same as portrayed in the fifth season. One difference is that rather than marrying Sansa Stark, Ramsay marries Sansa's friend Jeyne Poole who is being passed off as Arya. Theon knows immediately that it is not really Arya, and suspects that the Boltons have kept him alive because they need him to confirm to the Northern lords that it is her (since Theon is one of the few people still living who could positively identify Arya). Ergo, Theon ends up helping Jeyne escape from Winterfell, aided by a disguised Mance Rayder and his six spearwives. During the escape, Jeyne screams and accidentally gives away their position. Mance and the spearwives stay behind to buy them time, and Theon and Jeyne jump off the castle walls.

He does not take responsibility for any of his vile deeds and never blames himself for his predicament, only others - his sister, father, Ramsay.

This is a lie, because at that point of the story - Ramsay was not in a position to force Theon to do anything; he suggested that but Theon was the one in charge, and he made the decision, thus the blood of the boys (and their mother) is on his hands, not Ramsay's, but Theon wouldn't admit that. Second, he assures Stannis that the North remembers the Red Wedding, the sack of Winterfell Deepwood Motte and Torrhen's Square - but leaves out the atrocities that he performed (the sack of Stony Shore and the conquer of Winterfell ).

His real name might have been \"Heke\", but he was called \"Reek\" because he stank like rotting fish, apparently from some kind of medical condition, as the smell lingered no matter how much he bathed. When Ser Rodrik attempted to arrest Ramsay, he quickly switched clothes with his servant, so Rodrik ended up killing the servant while Ramsay passed himself off as Reek, and went back with them to Winterfell just before Theon's ironborn captured it. Ramsay later mockingly tortured Theon physically and psychologically until he was brainwashed into thinking he actually was Reek, and denying he was ever Theon. Or rather, Theon constantly reminds himself in his inner POV that \"I am Reek\", because when he showed any hint during his torture that he still considered himself \"Theon\" Ramsay would flay him again (Ramsay didn't just want him to say the words \"I am Reek\", but wanted him to even stop consciously thinking of himself as \"Theon Greyjoy\"). This subplot was cut from the TV series for screentime, and instead has Ramsay simply come up with the name \"Reek\" on a whim to demean and dehumanize Theon, noting that he stinks from being in the dungeons for so long, but Theon comes to insist that his name is Reek partly out of regret for the atrocities he committed against the Starks as Theon Greyjoy.

Overeager to earn the fame and renown of the older Sand Snakes and her father before them, Elia charges around on her horse announcing \"I'm Lady Lance!\" to all she meets hoping that she will earn it as a nickname, the way her father became known as \"the Red Viper\", even though Elia has yet to see any combat. Both Tyene and Elia are companions of their cousin Arianne Martell, Doran's daughter and heir. "}, {"context": "The TV series's version of Tyene Sand therefore seems to be a condensation of book-Tyene and book-Elia Sand into one character. This may have been due to worries about time constraints: given that there are already three Sand Snakes, \" Elia Sand \" might never appear in the TV show itself (though she has been mentioned by name in dialogue during Season 4). Similarly, during Season 2 the producers were seriously worried that Shireen Baratheon would never appear in future seasons - and in House Tyrell Loras and Margaery actually have two older brothers in the novels (Willas and Garlan) but they were also apparently cut for time. Elia Sand, however, is the only one of Ellaria's children to ever appear prominently in the novels so far: indeed, the few scenes between Ellaria and Elia are one of the few instances of a woman of color having a mother-daughter relationship in any of the novels. Otherwise it is only mentioned that Ellaria has daughters with Oberyn. The writers may have weighed this into this decision to combine the characters, wanting to actually show Ellaria having a mother-daughter relationship on-screen. "}, {"context": "Like book-Tyene, TV-Tyene is stated to be very skilled with poisons, her signature weapon. The difference is that, apparently to make her a bit more \"active\", the TV show changed this from subtly killing enemies with a scratch from a poisoned ring, to coating her daggers with poisons so she can take part in melee combat (though this does echo how her father coated his spear in poisons). Like book-Elia Sand, TV-Tyene is the eldest of Ellaria's daughters, but the youngest of the adult Sand Snakes - Ellaria's younger daughters are only small children, but Oberyn had older daughters from prior relationships. The actors have said that TV-Tyene has a youthful tendency to charge recklessly into danger without thinking, which also matches the impetuous nature of book-Elia Sand, trying to prove herself to her older sisters. "}, {"context": "One result of combining the two characters is that book-Tyene and book-Elia have different physical appearances due to having different mothers from different ethnicities. Book-Elia has the darker features of Dornishmen while book-Tyene has classic Andal features of blonde hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. Given that TV-Tyene is supposed to be Ellaria's daughter, she logically wouldn't look nearly as Andal/Northern European, so the TV show cast dark-haired Italian actress Rosabell Laurenti Sellers (just as book-Elia Sand looks more like Ellaria because she is her daughter). While this is closer to Ellaria in appearance than book-Tyene, Westeros.org did point out that the actress still doesn't look quite like TV-Oberyn and TV-Ellaria (i.e. they could have cast a Latina or South Asian actress).  Even so, this is not outside the realm of possibility when it comes to Dorne, which is a very multiethnic society, instead of having a rigidly uniform appearance. For example, Oberyn's squire Daemon Sand is a bastard of House Allyrion, who are classic olive-skinned \"Salty Dornishmen\" from the river valleys and coasts, but he has bright blue eyes and light sandy brown hair - apparently taking after the appearance of his non-Allyrion parent. Even the \"Stony Dornishmen\" of the mountains on Dorne's western border are basically Andal in appearance, blonde-haired and blue-eyed. Therefore it is not implausible that TV-Tyene simply inherited a bit more in appearance from one of Oberyn's or Ellaria's parents (or even grandparents), who happened to be Andal (i.e. one of Ellaria's parents might have been a Stony Dornishman from House Dayne or House Yronwood ). "}, {"context": "In the beginning of A Feast for Crows Tyene is the third of the Sand Snakes who confronts Prince Doran about his failure to avenge their father. She waits for him at the Old Palace in Sunspear. She is aware of Obara's plan to declare a war against the Lannisters and Nymeria's plan to poison Tywin, Cersei, Jaime and Tommen, but has a different plan: since Dornishmen fight best at home, they will crown Myrcella (who is the lawful heir of the Iron Throne, not Tommen, by the Dornish inheritance law) in order to provoke the Lannisters and the Tyrells to come down to Dorne; then the Dornish troops shall bleed them in the passes and bury them beneath the blowing sands, as happened many times before. Doran says grudgingly that he will think about that. Tyene is angered, claiming he thinks too much, like her father said, and accuses him of cowardice. Then she apologizes and leaves. MaesterCaleotteexamines Doran's palm to make sure he was not pricked by one of Tyene's needles. Doran gives orders to imprison Tyene and the other Sand Snakes, to make certain they will not ignite a war.

Currently, she is on the way to King's Landing. "}, {"context": "It should be note that as much as Tyene and her sisters are angry at their uncle for lack of action against the Lannisters, none of them has ever harmed him, Trystane or Myrcella; even if they had such intentions, Areo Hotah would have never allowed Tyene to take him down so carelessly as happened in the show: he always watches the Sand Snakes very carefully when they are around his prince (perhaps even more closely than he watches other people), knowing how deadly they are, ready to react to any potentially harmful move on their behalf. At one occasion, when Tyene raised her hand during a conversation with her uncle, Areo immediately brought the butt of his longaxe down upon the marble with a thump and warned her My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you. Tyene assured him innocently \"I meant no harm, Captain. I love my uncle, as I know he loved my father\". "}, {"context": "In stark contrast to the novels, Tyene and her two older sisters are portrayed in the TV show as ruthless, machine-like killers who commit cold-blooded murder solely for the fun of it, and Tyene is depicted as portraying a particularly sadistic streak, shown when she secretly poisons Bronn and briefly savors his suffering and near death before giving him the cure; she smiles as she gives Ellaria the antidote to a similar poison, knowing that it has just killed Myrcella, despite her innocence of any crime towards House Martell; and even goes as far as to kill Maester Caleotte during the coup for absolutely no reason at all (a possibility is that as a master poisoner, Tyene hated Caleotte for his position as a healer and took her chance to murder him when there was nobody left to punish her); in a sense of irony, she cries when she herself is poisoned by Cersei Lannister with the Long Farewell, despite having taken pleasure in ending numerous lives with the same poison.

Tyrion replies that they have something to show her, and Sandor Clegane brings out the wight that was captured north of the Wall. Shaken by what she sees, Cersei at first seems willing to accept a truce, but only if Jon Snow agrees to have the North remain neutral and support neither Queen. To Tyrion's dismay, Jon replies that he cannot do so, as he has already declared for Daenerys. In response, Cersei leaves the summit. Furious, Tyrion rebukes Jon for not being able to make a small lie in order to secure them a political and military advantage. He declares that he will go and speak with Cersei alone - despite Daenerys's protests that she will have him murdered - or else they will be right back where they started.  "}, {"context": "Tyrion is escorted into the Tower of the Hand by Gregor Clegane; he meets Jaime outside, who claims he tried to reason with Cersei until she threw him out. Tyrion then meets Cersei inside the same office both he and their father once occupied, as Hand of the King. Cersei accuses him of having tried to bring down House Lannister from the very beginning. Although she finally acknowledges that Tyrion did not kill Joffrey, she reminds him that he did kill their father, and holds him responsible for the deaths of her other children, as she believed no one would have touched Tommen or Myrcella while Tywin was alive. Tyrion truthfully claims he was unaware of Jon's bending the knee to Daenerys and expresses sincere regret for the deaths of his nephew and niece, but Cersei does not care, claiming he destroyed their House's future regardless of his intentions. Angered, Tyrion tries to goad her into having him killed, if she blames him for everything that has befallen her. Cersei looks ready to give the order to Ser Gregor, but reluctantly relents. Tyrion wonders why she allowed him to arrange the peace negotiations in the first place if she didn't expect anything to happen; Cersei turns the question back at him, wondering why he supports Daenerys as loyally as he does. Cersei dismisses Tyrion's assertions that Daenerys is better at controlling her violent impulses than she is. She expresses the horror she felt when she saw the wight, and her desire to keep her loved ones safe from them at any cost. From this and her gestures, Tyrion correctly deduces that she is pregnant with another incestuous child by Jaime.  "}, {"context": "Tyrion then returns to his allies at the Dragonpit, where they are joined shortly after by his brother and sister. Cersei claims she will agree to the truce and send the Lannister forces north to fight alongside the Starks and the Targaryens. After a discussion at Dragonstone over their journey to the North, Tyrion accompanies his Queen and Jon Snow aboard a ship that will take them to White Harbor. On the voyage, Tyrion witnesses Daenerys allowing Jon into her cabin, where the two of them give in to their mutual attraction and engage in a sexual encounter. Concerned with the possible political consequences for his Queen, Tyrion walks away.  "}, {"context": "Despite his harsh treatment at the hands of others over the years,Tyrion has managed to develop a thick skin and is able to brush off others' japes about his short stature (except when coming from his father). Tyrion advised Jon Snow how to handle his own bastard status, which reflects Tyrion's own approach to life: take your impediment in stride and wear it like armor, so it cannot be used to hurt you. Being born a dwarf and subject to ridicule for most of his life,Tyrionhas admittedly developed a soft spot for his fellow outcasts and has shown them kindness, such as having a saddle designed for the crippled Bran Stark allowing him to ride. Being physically weak, Tyrion is also upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly enraged when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill a defenseless baby girl, Barra (because she was one of Robert's bastards), and as punishment had him exiled to the Wall Tyrion is also genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. He also seems to have a level of honor and dignity that the rest of his family seem to lack; events such as the Red Wedding disgusted him, and he considered them to be crimes (though he did admit that there was a certain level of \"cheating\" in war that he is comfortable with, the Red Wedding went beyond that). One of his most interesting and enduring friendships is with the eunuch Varys, the Master of Whisperers. Tyrion and Varys connect on several levels: they are both social lepers because of a physical condition that most people treat with distaste, they are both brilliant intellectuals with a dry sense of humor, they both have a compassionate nature but are capable of being ruthless when necessary, and they are both fond of wine. Although Tyrion and Varys were wary of each other at first (mainly due to the extreme reputations they both maintained), they have developed trust over the course of their various adventures. "}, {"context": "Tyrion, however, is not without faults. He tends to overindulge in food, drink, and sex in part to self-medicate for the terrible treatment he's suffered most of his life; when overly stressed, upset or uncomfortable, he will quickly find the nearest container of wine or beer and consume most of it. Tyrion can also act vicious if he feels he's been wronged - such as confining Grand Maester Pycelle to the Black Cells for betraying him or, in his darkest hour, killing Shae for testifying against him during his trial and having an affair with his father, and then going on to kill Tywin himself. Because his father and sistertreated him like a social leper, Tyrion craves love and acceptance and is genuinely hurt when this is denied him by others. "}, {"context": "He has complex relationships with other members of his family, most of whom resent him and only thinly veil their contempt for his existence. His older sisterCerseiblames him for causing the death of their mother and has (as revealed during a conversation withOberyn) hatedTyrionsince his birth. His father,Tywin, sharesCersei's resentment forTyriondue to the death of his wife while birthing him, as Joanna Lannister was the only person Tywin ever loved. Although Tywin recognizes and respects Tyrion's intellect, it does not lessen his prejudice towards his youngest son; by the same token Tyrion fears and admires his father, but hates him for his inflexibility and unwillingness to show any love for his children. Tywin also just thinks it is an embarrassment that Tyrion was born with a physical disability, seeing it as a judgement from the gods meant to humiliate him by his son's mere existence. "}, {"context": "Only Tyrion's older brother Jaime maintained a good relationship withTyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down, and he has frequently attempted to come toTyrion'sdefense when his other family members treat him maliciously, making Jaime the only member of his immediate family whom Tyrion loves. Tyrionharbors a mutual admiration for Jaime, even naming him as his champion when he demanded a trial by combat while being held prisoner at theEyrie. However, this cozy relationship ended when Tyrion killed their father,although they seem to be reconciled since then. "}, {"context": "After he killed Shae and his father, Tyrion becomes a broken man: he had lost the will to live. Traumatized by killing the woman he loved and losing his lordship, influence and fabulous wealth, he becomes more cynical and pessimistic and was content to just drink himself to death instead of helping Varys to aid Daenerys Targaryen in getting the Iron Throne. Tyrion becomes convinced in the futility of everything, gaining a negative and rather fatalistic outlook on the past and the future, to the point of suicidal, as well gains a lower view for matters he dealt with high esteem and importance beforehand in the past, such as the Great Houses or the bid for the Iron Throne. Even when meeting Daenerys face to face, Tyrion explained that he was still content to die. However, whilst helping with the chaos in Meereen, and keeping Daenerys from becoming like her father in her ruthlessness, he regains his will to live. He also finally finds something to believe in, as he believes in Daenerys. His sense of humor is more muted and cynical than before, however; this may be the result of his no longer being able to rely on his family title for protection and influence, and having to earn his merits with Daenerys on his brains alone. "}, {"context": "Although Tyrion's skills with political maneuvering, administration, and diplomacy are extremely impressive, his record as a military strategist and tactician are more mixed. In this respect he is similar to his father, although unlike Tywin, Tyrion's lack of skill on the battlefield has more to do with his unwillingness to inflict heavy loss of life on either side. He achieved a successful ambush at the Battle of the Blackwater with his wildfire trap and led his troops personally on a sortie, but this alone was still not enough to win the battle without help from Tywin and the Tyrells; indeed, the massive casualties resulting from the wildfire shook him and (presumably) made him reluctant to use such a devastating weapon again. This, in turn, made him somewhat overly cautious in his strategy to help Daenerys win against Cersei. As a result, most of his battle plans, with the exception of capturing Casterly Rock, failed, leading Daenerys to lose her patience with his strategy and take matters into her own hands Nonetheless, Tyrion played a valuable role in developing and solidifying the alliance between Daenerys and Jon Snow, the King in the North.

However, the age gap between him and his siblings is smaller: in the books Tyrion was born when Cersei and Jaime were 10, while in the show, they were 4. This was likely to accommodate the actors: Peter Dinklage is four years older than Lena Headey and one year older than Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. "}, {"context": "As well as being a dwarf, Tyrion is misshapen and often described as ugly and having eyes of two different colors one green and one black. He is described as having a huge disproportionate head and an pronounced ungainly waddle when he walks. His hair is lank and very pale, but when he lets his beard grow in it comes in as a mixture of blonde and black hairs. In the beginning of the TV series, actor Peter Dinklage insisted on not having a beard, because he felt that bearded dwarfs are a fantasy stereotype, though he agreed to grow a beard from the fifth season onwards. "}, {"context": "Ever since he was a child, Tyrion has been interested in dragons. Heused to dream of riding a dragon, imagininghe was some lost Targaryen princeling, or a Valyrian dragonlord. He onceaskedhis uncles for one as a nameday present, and was devastated to hear that the last dragon had died a century ago. He eagerly reads any accounts he can find about dragons, though most of those are idle tales. On the way to Volantis, the sellsword Griff orders Tyrion to set down all he knows of dragonlore; the task is formidable, but Tyrion labors at it diligently. The thought about meeting Daenerys and her dragons makes Tyrion relive his childhood dreams.

He bought them a little cottage where they lived as man and wife for their two week marriage, before his father had it annulled. Tywin not only had 50 guards rape her, but then ordered Tyrion to have sex with her as well, giving her a gold piece as a Lannister is worth more.

Later when he tells his father that the plan to kill him by putting him in the vanguard (under the command of Ser Gregor Clegane) failed, Tyrion learns that his father had put him there hoping that an inexperienced Tyrion with undisciplined hill tribesmen would break and run to be pursued into a trap by the Stark forces. Tyrion holding the line had ruined the plan. It is a combination of this along with his reading of the situation they face in the war, and the fact that Jaime Lannister may not be retrievable, that makes Tywin decide to make use of Tyrion as acting Hand. Tyrion realizes that Tywin is preparing for the worst, that the Starks might well kill Jaime as revenge for Eddard's murder, so he is finally giving Tyrion real power. "}, {"context": "When Tyrion relieves Janos Slynt of command of the Gold cloaks it is a man named Ser Jacelyn Bywater or \"Ironhand\" who becomes their new commander, not Bronn. It is Varys, not Tyrion, who comes up with the suggestion to send Joffrey some prostitutes to soften his temper, but the results are not shown. Tyrion does not send Petyr Baelish to Catelyn Stark at Renly's camp with Lord Eddard's bones and an offer for the release of Jaime Lannister (though Baelish is sent to treat with the Tyrells after Renly's death). The bones are sent with Cleos Frey (replaced by Alton Lannister in the series) to Riverrun along with unacceptable peace terms and a force of 100 Lannister soldiers that hide four men Tyrion has sent to break Ser Jaime out, an escape attempt that fails. Shae is not brought to the Tower of the Hand, instead she is put in a manse that Tyrion can approach by using a tunnel from under a brothel. The most important of the defenses for the city that Tyrion builds is a huge chain that stretches across the whole of Blackwater Rush, to be raised after Stannis' fleet enters to trap them inside with the wildfire. "}, {"context": "In the book's version of the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion has almost his entire nose cut off by Ser Mandon Moore's sword swipe; the TV series only included the deep scar across his face (which as also present in the books).

But it would be next to impossible and very expensive to do that on television, and I would be wearing a green sock [on my nose, to digitally remove it with greenscreen], I think, for the next however many years, which I don't know how that would be on set.

When Oberyn Martell is killed and Tyrion is sentenced to death, he is freed by Jaime, who goes on to reveal that his marriage to Tysha was actually a proper marriage and he had been forced by Tywin to make it look like it had been staged. Enraged at such a betrayal, Tyrion vows revenge on Jaime, Cersei and Tywin, spitefully but falsely telling Jaime that he killed Joffrey, and it is for this reason that he confronts and kills Shae and then Tywin while he is on the privy (in the television series, he kills Tywin for Shae, which left some fans confused as to why Tyrion would kill his own father for a woman who committed the ultimate betrayal against him and who he himself had just killed).

Tyrion's escape also fuels Cersei's contempt of House Tyrell: a Tyrell coin is found in the cell of an undergaoler named Rugen (who is actually Varys in disguise), leading Cersei to believe that the Tyrells, particularly Margaery, might have conspired with Tyrion to murder Joffrey and helped him escape by bribing the guards.

Yet despite all this, Tywin is fully aware that Tyrion is the most intelligent, efficient, intellectual, sophisticated and politically cunning of all of his children. Though this has driven him to despise Tyrion more, given that Tyrion is his least favorite son as well as his most valuable, Tywin has occasionally recognized Tyrion's incredible intelligence by naming him acting Hand of the King and later Master of Coin, and betrothing him to Sansa Stark, all for the benefit of the family. When Tyrion is accused of murdering Joffrey, Tywin's reaction appears to show that he is not entirely convinced of Tyrion's guilt, knowing that Tyrion is much too smart to commit regicide in such an obvious manner, but rather than attempt to prove his son's innocence, he uses the opportunity to rid himself of Tyrion once and for all, either by execution or sending him to the Night's Watch. Though he seems to prefer the latter so as to avoid being branded a kinslayer, it is later implied that this was also part of a plan to push Jaime into renouncing his Kingsguard vows and taking his place as Tywin's heir in return for Tyrion's life. "}, {"context": "Meanwhile, Tywin possesses a very conservative, patrician set of social values, in which women are suited to securing marriage-alliances and little else, not wielding power on their own. Thus in contrast to House Tyrell in which female members of the family are trained in ruling and court intrigue as much as the men are, Tywin never trained Cersei how to rule. Without instruction from her father, because Tywin always disregarded her as simply a means to an end, Cersei turned into a queen who actually isn't very skilled at the art of ruling but who based her reign on her personal vendettas with Tyrion and Margaery. However, on one occasion Tywin outright stated to her that he distrusted her not because of her gender, but because she was not as smart as she thought herself to be. This assessment appears quite accurate, as Cersei's attempts to increase her power following Tywin's death simply left her more and more isolated and despised by the people of Westeros. "}, {"context": "Of his three children Tywin has the least shame and most empathy for Jaime, though not outright respect. Tywin feels disappointed that Jaime wants to continue to be a member of the Kingsguard, as while it is the highest honor a knight can aspire to, it means that Jaime had to swear away his rights to marriage or inheritance, which would leave Tywin's hated son Tyrion as his heir. WhenJaime was captured by the Starks, Tywin did absolutely nothing to bring him back. Tywin also attempted to do anything to convince Jaime to be his heir, even going on to promise sparing Tyrion's life, which was though ultimately foiled. "}, {"context": "Tywin does have a generally good relationship with his younger brother Kevan, whom he shaped his whole life to serve as his faithful lieutenant. On the whole, however, for a man who claims to value family above all else, Tywin has hypocritically destroyed his relationships with his own children. "}, {"context": "Tywin is also shown to have no regard for his grandson Joffrey, knowing fully well that he is incompetent at ruling the realm. He was shown as having no qualms with putting Joffrey in his place when necessary, normally being cold and blunt with the boy and exerting authority over him when need be. On one occasion when Joffrey defied Tywin about having to walk a long distance to council meetings, Tywin coldly suggested having Joffrey carried there; the second time, when Joffrey heatedly insulted Tywin as a coward, Tywin sent Joffrey to his chambers even suggesting Essence of Nightshade to help him sleep. Beforehand, Tywin exercised his belief that \"any man who must say I am the king is no true king\", and that the crown and title of king didn't truly give a man absolute power. At Joffrey's funeral, Tywin was very cold and careless toward his grandson's body, and he openly tells his grandson Tommen that Joffrey was not a good king nor a wise king much to the chagrin of Cersei. "}, {"context": "Tywin lacks, or at least overtly lacks, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of his grandson Joffrey. Tywin is intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. When Tywin arrived at Lannister-occupied Harrenhal he put a stop to the pointless torture of captured smallfolk, simply because it would be a more efficient use of resources to put them to work. In contrast, during the Sack of King's Landing he allowed his army to murder, pillage and rape throughout the city, devastating its inhabitants. Underneath his calm exterior, Tywin can be seen to take personal satisfaction in crushing anyone who openly humiliates him (Tyrion, House Reyne of Castamere, Robb Stark, Aerys Targaryen etc.) though he only seeks this kind of vengeance when it is practical for House Lannister. Tywin treated his plans for the Red Wedding as a necessity of ending the war against the North, and he had the Stark family sword, Ice melted down because it was made out of irreplaceable Valyrian steel which could be used to make other weapons. Privately, however, he bore a look of satisfaction as he personally threw Ice's wolf-pelt scabbard into a fire, symbolizing his destruction of House Stark in the same way he had destroyed the Reynes when they humiliated his family. "}, {"context": "Despite his ruthless and calculating nature, Tywin is shown to have a good side if he is impressed with someone, demonstrated when he treats his young servant and cupbearer (unaware that she is Arya Stark) with respect and kindness when she displays knowledge and the ability to read, speaks openly with her and even allows her to eat his dinner when he is not hungry and treat herself to whatever she likes in the kitchen (though considering an earlier \"assassination\" attempt on him, Tywin was probably also being cautious about poisoned food). He also demonstrates this constructive and caring side with his grandson Tommen, whom he knows will become a much better and wiser king than Joffrey, and shares his knowledge and wisdom concerning the duties and obligations of a king. "}, {"context": "Although Tywin's skill at politics and administration cannot be denied, his military record is mixed. During Robert's Rebellion, Tywin participated in none of the battles except his infamous sacking of King's Landing when it was already clear that Robert Baratheon would win the war. During the Greyjoy Rebellion Tywin lost his entire fleet to a surprise attack by Euron Greyjoy and in the War of the Five Kings he badly underestimated Robb Stark and was repeatedly outmaneuvered on the battlefield (though on at least one occasion this was due to an incompetent subordinate). However, Tywin later turned the tables by winning a spectacular victory at the Battle of Blackwater (thanks in part to his new alliance with House Tyrell), and although his actions at the Red Wedding the destruction of House Reyne and the Sack of King's Landing were extremely brutal and heinous, they produced decisive military results. While Tywin might not be much of a field commander, he is certainly a good strategist: he always has the endgame in mind, and always knows how to best inspire fear in his enemies.

While he doesn't trust any of the Great Houses apart from his own, Tywin recognizes it as necessary to make some concessions to House Tyrell and House Martell in order to keep their valuable support. Following his death, however, Cersei spurns the Martells and re-ignites her previous rivalry with Margaery Tyrell eventually destroying both alliances and undoing Tywin's careful work in securing House Lannister.

"}, {"context": "Tywin has four siblings: Kevan, Gerion, Tygett and Genna. His father, Lord Tytos was a weak ruler who was mocked by many of his vassals, and dominated by his mistress - a woman who was scarcely above a whore. As a result, Tywin has grown to be a hard and cold man, who mistrusts laughter, and hates whores. "}, {"context": "When Tytos agreed to marry his daughter Genna to Walder Frey's son Emmon, who was his second son and thus not even his heir, simply to please Lord Frey, Tywin was the only one who spoke out against this, pointing out how drastically uneven the match was: even if Walder had offered his eldest son and heir in marriage, it would still have been marrying beneath Genna's station. Genna appreciated the fact that her elder brother who spoke against the betrothal. "}, {"context": "When House Reyne of Castamere and House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall rose against House Lannister, young Tywin led his House's armies and crushed the revolt. He executed every member of the rebel houses, completely extinguishing them, and put their castles to the torch. The Reyne rebellion inspired the song \" The Rains of Castamere \", which became an anthem of sorts for House Lannister and served as a potent warning to all those who considered crossing Lord Tywin. When House Farman became recalcitrant, Lord Tywin sent him a man with a lute who began playing \"The Rains of Castamere\". Lord Farman took the hint and caused no further trouble. "}, {"context": "He was the Hand of the King under King Aerys II Targaryen for twenty years. Tywin's term in office as Hand of the King was very successful, to the point that he was essentially the only man holding the kingdom together as Aerys II grew increasingly more insane over the years. Aerys also became increasingly jealous of his Hand. The TV series does not state this, but the reason the Mad King had Ilyn Payne 's tongue torn from his mouth with hot irons was because he overheard Payne remarking that Tywin was the real ruler of the kingdoms. The intense relationship between king and Hand escalated to the point that other lords knew the easiest way to appeal to Aerys was to mock Tywin; as Kevan Lannister states decades later, Tywin maintained stability in the Seven Kingdoms to the best of his ability, but all it earned him was a mad king's envy. "}, {"context": "A string of insults from Aerys eventually prompted Tywin's resignation. The Crown Prince Rhaegar was betrothed to Elia Martell rather than Cersei as Tywin had hoped. The King remarked: \"a man does not marry his heir to his servant's daughter\". Then, Jaime was named to the Kingsguard, which deprived Tywin of his first born heir, as Kingsguard vows prevent them from marrying and inheriting titles, and also effectively gave the King a hostage for Lord Tywin's good behavior. When Aerys pettily refused to allow Jaime to compete in the great tourney at Harrenhal it was the final straw and Tywin resigned and returned home to Casterly Rock. Thereafter, Aerys II's rule rapidly spiraled out of control, which in turn only fueled the Mad King's paranoia. "}, {"context": "When Robert's Rebellion erupted, Tywin remained neutral, ignoring pleas from both the Crown and the rebels for his aid. Only after the decisive Battle of the Trident which all but assured the rebels of victory, did he call his banners and march on King's Landing Pycelle convinced the King that Lord Tywin had arrived to protect the capital. However, when the Lannister army was admitted, they proceeded to sack the city and murdered the royal family. Gregor Clegane personally killed Rhaegar's infant son by bashing his head in, then - while covered in the blood and brains of her baby - raped and killed Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell. Meanwhile Amory Lorch another of Lord Tywin's bannermen, killed the three year old Princess Rhaenys by stabbing her to death. The children's bodies were then presented to Robert as proof of House Lannister's loyalty to the new regime. Tywin later explained to Tyrion that such a demonstration of loyalty was necessary, as he had played no part in the war until it was almost over, and Robert would have been grateful that he had been spared from having to murder the royal children himself. Tywin did, however, concede that there was no need to kill Elia, as she was not a Targaryen. He opined that Gregor probably killed her purely out of cruelty merely because he not been specifically ordered to spare her. "}, {"context": "This action spawned the original friction between House Lannister and Ned Stark, who correctly observed that the Lannisters only intervened when it was convenient, and that they could not be trusted. Further, Ned was disgusted that the Lannister army had dishonorably sacked the city and even killed Rhaegar Targaryen's small children (as Aemon recounts to Jon in the TV series). Tywin's defense when confronted by Ned was that he never personally ordered Gregor to kill the royal children, but Tywin also did nothing to punish Gregor. It is Ned's disgust at Tywin's actions during the Sack of King's Landing that drive how he deals with Cersei's betrayal, because even if Cersei's children are bastards born of incest, Ned knows that Robert would have all three killed if he told him, and Ned fears that this would make himself no better than Tywin.

Jaime, sick and tired of the corruption, injustice and political manipulations around him, refuses to act ashis father's puppet anymore and exclaims in rage \"I am a knight of the Kingsguard.

Tywin, furious that his own sondares to speak to him so defiantly and disrespectfully,answers harshly \" You are not my son \" (almost the same words he told Tyrion, after the latter shot him). This is their last conversation in the books. Kevan tries to make peace between them, but in vain. "}, {"context": "Tywin's actual position on female members of his family taking part in political decisions is somewhat ambiguous in the books - particularly because Tywin's behavior is noted within the narrative for being hypocritical and at times contradictory. He does act like a very conservative and patrician male head of his household, but other characters remark that his love for his late wife Joanna was so great that she was actually his closest advisor. In her adult life, Tywin seems to have shunned Cersei from politics, but this was not always the case. The books state that Tywin actually doted on Cersei when she was a little girl, and even shared his plans with her in secret. All of this changed as Cersei grew older, however, when Tywin forced her into a loveless marriage to Robert Baratheon to secure a political alliance. Cersei felt betrayed that the father who once included her in his strategies now used her only as a tool, and increasingly blamed it on the secondary status of women in Westeros society. As in the TV series, however, it seems that as Cersei grew older Tywin correctly realized that she simply wasn't very intelligent or skilled at politics, so he eventually stopped wasting the time and effort of trying to train her at all. Similarly to Kevan and Jaime, he came to the conclusion that Cersei was totally incompetent as a mother, and intended to send Tommen to Casterly Rock, to be raised away from her.

When Jaime releases Tyrion from the black cells, he confesses that Tyrion's first wife, Tysha, was not really a whore, and Jaime had not arranged their encounter on the road. Tywin forced Jaime to tell Tyrion that story to teach him a lesson. Ergo, she (presumably) had genuinely loved Tyrion. Enraged by this revelation, Tyrion vows to take revenge on his family. Ignoring Varys ' protestations, he climbs a long ladder up to a secret passage in Tywin's chambers, where, as in the TV series, he finds Shae in his father's bed and strangles her. He then confronts his father in the privy. Tywin tries to assure Tyrion that he still intends to send him to the Wall and is only awaiting Mace Tyrell 's approval. The conversation turns to Tysha. Tywin remains belligerent, continually referring to her as a whore. Tyrion warns him not to use the word whore again. When he inquires what became of Tysha, Tywin nonchalantly retorts that she went \"wherever whores go\". Remembering his father's own lesson that one should never make an empty threat, Tyrion fires the crossbow at him.

All present are ordered not to mention that a whore had been found in his bed. Tywin's corpse soon begins to smell horribly, to the point where mourners at his funeral feel physically sick; Tommen dashes out of the sept and vomits.

In the first two generations of Targaryen kings, Aegon I and his sons, there had simply been no official ruling on what succession laws the royal family would follow (given how different Valyrian inheritance was from Andal customs). The Blacks regarded the Greens' justification as obvious propaganda, though several who supported the Greens honestly felt that the relatively new Targaryen dynasty - now that it was established as the rulers of the Seven Kingdom) - should have adopted the standard inheritance law of the Seven Kingdoms. No one thought to retroactively make Rhaenys the new monarch, though this was largely irrelevant given that Rhaenys was one of the Blacks: Rhaenys's son had been Rhaenyra's first husband Laenor, and thus Rhaenyra's heir-apparent was Rhaenys's eldest grandson Jacaerys.

The following day, Drogo allows Viserys to ride in one of the khalasar's carts; Viserys accepts, thinking this is Drogo apologizing for the offense Daenerys did him.

When he meets Jaime Lannister, he speaks with the man as if they are equals (although Jaime has personally killed many men while Walder merely sat and watched as others died), calling himself a conqueror. He also credited himself as a kingslayer like Jaime for his involvement in the Red Wedding, even though it had been Roose Bolton who had killed Robb Stark.

Walder gloated that Brynden Tully had fallen to foot soldiers, even though he had never personally stepped into combat, considering generally defeating one's enemy to be a victory - the very fact that he considered himself (an old man who called for the aid of stronger people to achieve his victories) to be on par with Jaime Lannister (who actually killed his king and was trained by heroes, and has participated in actual battles) shows that Walder is narrow-minded. He considers the fact that his enemies are dead and he is not to be a personal victory, and he acts like a strong, respected man and a crucial ally, when he is not essentially a valued ally of the Lannisters. "}, {"context": "In his final moments, however, Walder's swagger crumbles instantly when he is caught off guard by Arya with no one to protect him, and he shows his cowardice when he attempts to flee before she kills him, proving Tyrion Lannister right when he said that Walder was many things but not brave.

His house has grown rich by building and maintaining the Twins, two castles that control the only crossing over the Green Fork of the River Trident for hundreds of miles. He is proud and haughty, but also crafty.He isalso bald and too gouty to move by himself. The fact that he controls such a strategic castle, and that most of the Great Houses have connections to the Freys through marriage, gives him free reign to switch allegiances numerous times, as all sides need him and his castle, and all sides have family connections to his family through his multitude of descendants. "}, {"context": "Hoster Tully disparagingly nicknamed him \"the Late Walder Frey\" when he arrived with his Frey soldiers at the site of the Battle of the Trident after the battle was already over. Walder almost certainly did this on purpose, because he saw no reason to endanger Frey soldiers for the sake of anyone but himself, despite the fact that he had sworn oaths of fealty to the Tullys and it was his duty to aid them in the battle. Nonetheless, Walder maintained a hypocritical grudge against Hoster for years afterwards - because Hoster made the entirely valid and accurate criticism that Walder was disloyal and had failed to uphold his own vows. This is part of the overall pattern of Walder's selfish character: throughout the narrative, Walder seems to be unable to conceptually understand that others will fault him for breaking oaths he has made. In turn, when those he has broken promises to become angered at him, he seems to honestly believe that they are harassing him for no justifiable reason. Similarly, when the War of the Five Kings broke out, Walder Frey should have allowed Robb Stark's army to pass through the Twins, and added his own Frey soldiers to his army, because he was a vassal of House Tully. Other Tully bannermen such as the Blackwoods or Mallisters sent their armies to join Robb at Riverrun simply for the asking, because it was their sworn duty. In contrast, Walder extorted his overlords into promising a marriage-alliance, ignoring all previous oaths he had made to them. Walder later became enraged when Robb Stark broke this promise of a marriage-alliance - but his anger was entirely hypocritical, given that Walder himself is the one who broke his promise of unconditional support for the Tullys, by demanding a marriage-alliance which he had no right to ask for in the first place.

Following Euron's victory, Asha and her supporters travel overland through Great Wyk before sailing back to Deepwood Motte. Euron doesn't openly say that he wants to kill Theon and Asha, as he did in the TV series: everyone thinks Theon is dead at the time, and he thinks of a more politically correct tactic to sideline her.

She soon receives a taunting letter from Ramsay Bolton revealing that Theon is actually still alive and being tortured in his dungeon; she feels sorry for her brother, but does not intend to rescue him. On learning of this, Tristifer Botley (who wishes to marry Asha) explains to her the history of Torgon the Latecomer: that a Kingsmoot can be declared invalid by the priests if one of the prior king's lawful sons was not present to put forward his candidacy. The story gives Asha an idea: Theon probably wouldn't win an election even if they manage to rescue him, but Asha realizes that his mere survival would give a pretext for the Drowned Men to invalidate Euron's election and call for a new Kingsmoot. Given that the Drowned Men hate Euron as an \"ungodly\" man they would probably agree to this, and several of the major lords who voted for Euron are starting to grow uneasy at his dark behavior, there's a good chance Asha could hold and win a new Kingsmoot if she manages to recover Theon.

Ser Justin claims the fact that Asha is currently married is not a problem: her marriage was done with a proxy, and was never consummated, and therefore can be annulled; besides, Erik Ironmaker has one foot in the grave.

Two years after the war ended, Peake betrayed Alicent by having young Jaehaera thrown out of a tower window to her death - ironically echoing how Alicent had betrayed those who had trusted her to usurp a higher royal position for her own child.

Watching over the castle courtyard from the balcony, Arya reminisces about how their father used to watch her and her brothers train in the very same spot, bitterly claiming that Sansa wouldn't remember due to the fact that she was usually inside the castle knitting with her fellow ladies.

However, Arya is adamant to point out that had she been in Sansa's position, she would have died before betraying her family, calling her stupid for believing in the Lannisters' lies. Arya reveals that she, like Sansa, was present during their father's execution and that she saw the whole thing from the statue of Baelor.

Sansa, unwilling to play, instead insists that Arya explain the nature of her faces. Arya reveals that with the faces, she can be whomever she wants to be. Grasping her Valyrian steel catspaw dagger, she approaches her sister in a somewhat threatening manner, wondering aloud what it might feel like to wear pretty silk dresses and be the Lady of Winterfell should she take Sansa's face.

Arya watches with satisfaction as Sansa and Bran turn the tables on Littlefinger and finally call him into account for his crimes, with Arya herself reminding Petyr that her new Valyrian steel dagger originally belonged to him. When Baelish's attempts to manipulate the situation turn to pleading, Arya moves in and slits his throat with his own dagger at Sansa's direction. Later, Arya and Sansa discuss their pasts, Arya saying that she couldn't have survived what Sansa survived. Sansa says she thinks Arya could have, Arya being the strongest person she knows.

To ensure that his dream would not die, Aegon spent most of his time traveling the various Kingdoms on royal progresses to remind lords and smallfolk who ruled them and to make his presence familiar to them. He also refrained from trying to unite the Kingdoms under the same laws, instead allowing them to retain their old laws and he would judge crimes committed in these Kingdoms according to their customs.

In 4 AC, the Targaryens decided that the time had come to finish the Conquest and they returned to conquer Dorne. However, the Dornish proved just as elusive as before and the dragons that had united six out of Seven Kingdoms proved useless. Eventually, the war took a different turn when Rhaenys, Aegon's youngest sister and his favorite wife, was killed in Dorne when her dragon Meraxes took an arrow in the eye. Aegon's fury and grief at the loss of his wife was such that he headed for Dorne himself. Accompanied by Visenya, the last two Targaryens rained fire upon the desert strongholds to break the Dornish. The next two years were known as the Dragon's Wroth, a period when every Dornish castle felt the fury of the dragonriders The only castle spared was Sunspear the seat of House Martell in hopes that the Dornish would turn against their liege lords. The strategy failed and Dorne remained unconquered. Aegon and Visenya placed bounties on the heads of the Dornish lords who retaliated by doing the same. The Conqueror was almost killed by assassins in the streets of King's Landing and was only saved by Visenya. This led to the creation of the Kingsguard with its first members chosen by Visenya to protect her brother with their lives. When Princess Meria Martell died in 13 AC, her son, Prince Nymor, sued for peace, having grown weary of war. He sent his daughter, Deria, to King's Landing to treat with the Conqueror. The peace demanded by Dorne was a peace between two sovereign kingdoms, not between a liege and his vassal. Although Aegon heard her out (against the advice of his advisors, such as Orys and Visenya), he apparently decided to refuse the request for peace. Before he could speak, Deria mounted the Iron Throne and placed a letter from her father in his hand. What was in the letter is unknown but Aegon's hand was so clenched around it that it started to bleed. He burnt the letter and left on Balerion for Dragonstone. The next morning, he returned and signed the peace treaty proposed by the Prince of Dorne, recognizing its as a sovereign kingdom.

Alicent had him executed as a result, but this hobbled Aegon II's Small Council by robbing it of an experienced Master of Coin, particularly given that they needed funds for the war. The Lannisters were wooed into his allegiance by naming Ser Tyland Lannister the new Master of Coin, but they frequently butted heads. Rhaenyra formed her own rival Small Council, and by all accounts, was a skilled administrator who was respected by the council members. In contrast, Aegon II was so inexperienced, untrained, and hotblooded that he was frequently at odds with his own Small Council. One of the reasons Rhaenyra's faction was able to gain so much ground despite not controlling the capital city is because of the fact that Aegon II could not adequately make use of those advantages he did possess.

Only four dragons had survived the Dance: Silverwing, the Cannibal, Sheepstealer (who was missing and presumed dead), and one other (who only hatched late in the war). The dragons were inbred to begin with, descending only from the original three brought to Westeros by Aegon I and his sisters. The final two dragons were hatched and then died during Aegon III's long reign: they were stunted, sickly creatures not much bigger than large dogs, and they did not live long. Some speculate that the Maesters poisoned the last dragons, because as men of science and learning they feared and hated the magical powers associated with the creatures.

Duncan the Small famously abdicated his place in the line of succession to marry a commoner, Jenny of Oldstones (a story which has become a favorite theme of romantic songs, which gave Sansa Stark an idealized vision of courtly love). Shaera was supposed to marry Luthor Tyrell Jaehaerys was supposed to marry a Tully girl, and Daeron was supposed to marry the young Olenna Redwyne Aegon V was determined to put an end to the incestuous marriage practices of the Targaryens but this only seemed to encourage a forbidden romance between Jaehaerys and Shaera, who eloped and married without his permission. Daeron, a splendid and brave knight, did not want to marry Olenna either - and is heavily implied to be homosexual in The World of Ice and Fire Thus after his two older brothers broke their betrothals he broke his as well, saying that his father could not rightfully force him to marry against his will when he had already relented for his two elder brothers.

Further, Aemon was already a blind old man, and a respected member of the Night's Watch for decades.

Unlike in the books, Aerys is portrayed as having little to no facial hair towards the end of his life - apparently just a drastic oversight on the part of the TV production team, as the animated Blu-ray featurettes produced in Season 6 itself explicitly mentioned the Mad King's bizarre, unkempt appearance. "}, {"context": "In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aerys II's reign began with great promise. Taking the throne at only the age of 20, Aerys installed a number of younger, vigorous and capable men in positions of power, while his own son Rhaegar showed promise of being a great king in his turn. Aerys, impressed by the young Ser Tywin Lannister's ruthlessness and effectiveness in crushing the Reyne Rebellion made Tywin, then heir to Casterly Rock his Hand of the King Tywin served very effectively as Hand for twenty years, during which the Seven Kingdoms prospered. "}, {"context": "Under Aerys's reign, the office of his Hand passed through five times, all of them suffered an unpleasant fate: "}, {"context": "However, Aerys, who occasionally showed signs of a terrible temper, became erratic following the brief uprising known as the Defiance of Duskendale, when he was held prisoner for several months by a rebellious lord before finally being rescued by Barristan Selmy Aerys's fury on that occasion was terrible: all of those involved in the incident were killed, several by being burned alive. After that, his rage could no longer be held in check. "}, {"context": "Aerys's relationship with Tywin Lannister began to deteriorate in these later years, as Aerys grew ever more paranoid about Tywin's ambition. When Ser Ilyn Payne captain of the guards for Tywin Lannister, made a joke that Tywin as Hand was the real ruler of Westeros, Aerys had his tongue cut out for the insult. Tywin could neither protest nor stop the punishment. The strains on their relationship were exacerbated by Aerys' well known lust for Tywin's wife Joanna Lannister which the former crudely expressed during her bedding  His marriage with his own sister-wife, Queen Rhaella, which had never been happy (they wereforced to marry against their will) became violent and abusive towards the end. "}, {"context": "During Aerys's reign period there were various rumors about him and Joanna: that Aerys took Joanna's maidenhead on the night of his father Jaehaerys's coronation, and that Joanna was one of Aerys's many mistresses, which was the reason for her abrupt dismissal by the queen. Pycelle insisted those rumors were baseless. There were, however, occasions of improper behavior of Aerys toward Joanna: when she returned to the court with her six-year old twins, drunken Aerys asked her if nursing her children had ruined her breasts, humiliating her and Tywin. When she died giving birth to Tyrion, the king commented that was done by the gods to teach Tywin some humility at last.  "}, {"context": "Over the years Aerys became increasingly gripped by madness, experiencing vivid hallucinations and delusional paranoia. Aerys became obsessed with fire, frequently burning his perceived enemies alive. Eventually, he was having women and babies roasted on spits in the throne room because the voices in his head told him they were plotting his ruin. Aerys would often become sexually aroused after burning someone to death, at which he would savagely rape his wife Queen Rhaella (his daughter Daenerys was the product of one such attack, quite possibly the same day he killed Rickard and Brandon Stark). Attempts to restrain Aerys's delusional behavior only fueled his paranoia that all were against him. "}, {"context": "Aerys's growing madness took a drastic toll on his physical appearance. Fearful of allowing blades in his presence (save those of his sworn Kingsguard), Aerys ceased to have his hair or nails cut for years. By the time of the rebellion, his fingernails had grown nearly a foot long, and his long, filthy, tangled hair and beard hung below his shoulders. Increasingly paranoid that someone would attempt to poison him, he ate so rarely that he became extremely gaunt. Combined with the stress from his madness, by the time of the rebellion, when Aerys was only forty years old, he looked as old and haggard as a man twice his age. Due to his insane meanderings, he accidentally cut his hands and thighs so many times on the Iron Throne that they were practically covered in scabs, leading some to refer to him as \"King Scab\" behind his back. "}, {"context": "Tywin had long hoped that Aerys would reward his service with a royal wedding, between his daughter Cersei and Prince Rhaegar. However, Tywin was infuriated when Aerys snubbed him by saying that Tywin was a mere servant of the crown, and no servant's daughter was fit to marry a prince of royal blood, and agreed to a marriage between Rhaegar and Elia Martell of Dorne instead. The last straw came when Aerys appointed Tywin's eldest son and heir Jaime Lannister to his Kingsguard Normally this was the highest honor a knight could achieve, and Jaime himself was eager to accept, but it meant that Jaime had to forsake all claims as Tywin's heir (leaving his stunted and hated younger son Tyrion as his heir). Privately, Aerys had truly agreed to promote Jaime to the Kingsguard to keep him around the royal court at all times, essentially as an unwitting hostage in case Tywin ever decided to turn on him. Outraged by the continual insults he endured from Aerys, Tywin resigned as Hand of the King on some thin pretext; the Hands that followed were a succession of Aerys's cronies, who he later turned on for various failures, exiling or executing them depending on his whims. "}, {"context": "After he burned several prominent lords alive and sanctioned his son's kidnap of Lyanna Stark, half of the realm rose in revolt against Aerys in Robert's Rebellion Many who fought on the Targaryen side in the war weren't even fighting for the insane Aerys so much as for his promising son, Crown Prince Rhaegar. Indeed, one of the main reasons so many put up with Aerys's insanity for as long as they did was because they hoped they could simply wait out the few remaining years in Aerys's reign until Rhaegar took the throne, instead of having to face the serious moral dilemma of breaking their oaths against the currently ruling king. Robert Baratheon's victory over Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident was therefore a double-blow to the Targaryen side: not only had the main royal army been defeated and scattered, but with Rhaegar dead, lords who had been on the fence decided to openly side with the rebels rather than fight for Aerys. Chief among these was Tywin Lannister himself, who had stayed out of the war until that point, who marched the 10,000 strong Lannister army to the gates of King's Landing, and once let inside, promptly began to sack the capital city "}, {"context": "Aerys's manner of death is slightly different from book to series. In the TV series, it is mentioned several times that Jaime stabbed him in the back, whereas in the book he slit Aerys's throat at the foot of the Iron Throne. It is never mentioned that Aerys ever said the words \"Burn them all\". However, the Season 3 episode \" Kissed by Fire \" brought Aerys's death closer in line to the books, when Jaime recounts to Brienne of Tarth that he stabbed Aerys in the back when he tried to run, and then Jaime proceeded to slit his throat to make sure he was dead. "}, {"context": "Another change is that Eddard Stark was not the first to find that Jaime killed Aerys: before Jaime could leave and let some braggart take the credit/blame, Elys Westerling and Lord Roland Crakehall entered and saw him standing over Aerys's body. Crakehall was not surprised, figuring (incorrectly) that Jaime killed the king so the Lannisters could seize the throne. He asked Jaime, \"Shall I proclaim a new king as well?\" Jaime knew what he meant: either Tywin, or Robert Baratheon, or one of the surviving Targaryens. He considered for a moment to name either the boy Viserys or baby Aegon. But when he glanced down again at Aerys's body, he thought \" his blood is in both of them\". \"Proclaim who you bloody well like\" he told Crakehall. Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark. "}, {"context": "In a minor change from the books, Aerys II is said to be the son of King Aegon V Targaryen, rather than his grandson. His father, Jaehaerys II, appears to have been eliminated from the roll of kings. The reason for this appears to be to simplify the relationship between Maester Aemon - Aegon V's older brother - and the other Targaryens (by making Aemon Daenerys 's great-uncle, rather than great-great-uncle). "}, {"context": "Unlike in the show, Daenerys is never told the whole ugly truth about her father: what Ser Barristan Selmy tells her in the novels is a very \"sugarcoated\" version, sticking to positive facts, belittling greatly the negative facts, and entirely omitting the countless atrocities the Mad King committed (mainly the repeated brutal raping of the queen, the murder of every member of House Darklyn and House Hollard after the Defiance of Duskendale and the execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark). The worst thing Selmy ever tells Daenerys about her father is that he lusted after Tywin's wife and acted indecently at her bedding. "}]}]
